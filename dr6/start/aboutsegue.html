<h1>About SEGUE</h1>

<p>The <em>Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Exploration</em> (<a href="http://segue.uchicago.edu">SEGUE</a>) is
mining the stellar content of the Milky Way in order to create a
detailed 3-dimensional map of the Galaxy. SEGUE will ultimately obtain
spectra of 240,000 stars in the disk and spheroid, revealing the age,
composition and phase space distribution of stars within the various
Galactic components. These stellar excavations will provide essential
clues for understanding the structure, formation and evolution of our
Galaxy.  The SEGUE project, scheduled to run through June 30, 2008, is
releasing data to the public as part of SDSS-II DR6.  This initial
SEGUE data release consists of imaging of approximately 1166 square
degree of lower Galactic latitude sky (most with <var>b</var> &lt; 35
degrees), with this <a
href="../seguephotogal_big.gif">SEGUE Imaging
Footprint</a>.  Additionally, approximately 100,000 SEGUE
spectra on 169 plates (with this <a
href="../seguespectrogal_big.gif">SEGUE
Spectroscopic Footprint</a>) are available.  Note that SEGUE obtains
its spectroscopic target positions from both the Legacy <a
href="../dr6photogal_big.gif">SDSS Imaging Footprint</a> and the
new, lower latitude SEGUE Imaging.</p>

<p>SEGUE is not a full sky spectroscopic survey, but rather it
sparse-samples the Galaxy in about directions separated by about 10 to
20 degrees on the sky with a pair of spectroscopic plates of area 7
square degrees, obtaining approximately 1100 science spectra toward
each of approximately 200 sightlines by survey's end (spectra toward
about 80 of these sightlines are available with DR6).  We offer a page
showing the <a href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/skycoverage.html">
current status of the SEGUE survey</a>, and a page allowing to <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/segueplatelist.html">browse the 100,000
SEGUE spectra</a>.</p>

<p>There is a page describing the <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/seguescience.html">science goals of
SEGUE</a> and a <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/seguedocuments.html">white paper
describing the SEGUE project</a>.</p>

<p>New for DR6 is the first release, in SQL searchable database form,
of estimates of stellar atmospheric parameters, including metallicity,
effective temperature and surface gravity along with radial velocity
and stellar classification information for each star.  These
quantities are tabulated and fully searchable (via SQL) in the <a
href="../products/spectra/spectroparameters.html">sppParams</a> table
of the DR6 CAS database.  Line indicies for common species are also
tabulated for all stars in <a
href="../products/spectra/spectrolineindices.html">sppLines</a>.</p>

<p>An introduction to the SEGUE spectra is given at <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/getstarted.html">http://segue.sdss.org/getstarted.html</a>. There
are also <a href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/targetsel.html">notes on
the Target Selection for SEGUE</a>.</p>

<h2>Important note about linking SEGUE imaging and spectra in the CAS</h2>

<p>The SEGUE spectra count as <a
href="../products/spectra/special.html">special-plate</a> spectra in
the CAS and are <strong>not</strong> considered to be
&quot;scienceprimary&quot;. Therefore, they are <em>not</em> linked to the
photometry in the usual way, e.g., they do not appear in the object
browser's default view like galaxy, quasar and stellar spectra from
the legacy survey. Moreover, all SEGUE spectra are in the
<code>BESTDR6</code> database, while most of the SEGUE imaging is in
the <code>SEGUEDR6</code> database of the CAS, so that linking imaging
and spectroscopy data requires special care. See the <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/getstarted.html#ex4">SEGUE sample SQL
query for instructions on joining SEGUE imaging and
spectroscopy</a>.</p>

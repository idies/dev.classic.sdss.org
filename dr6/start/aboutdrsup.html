<h1>The SDSS Data Release 6 Supplemental (DR6sup)</h1>

<p>The original description of the original DRsup, along with that of
DR5 to which it originally referred, are described in the <a
href="./dr5.pdf">DR5 paper, Adelman-McCarthy et al. 2007, ApJ
Supplements, in press [pdf, 1 MB]</a>. The DR6 paper is in preparation.</p>
      
<h2>What DR6sup contains</h2>

<p>As described in <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/dr6/start/aboutdr5.html">about DR5</a>,
there are a number (about 361) "special" and "extra" plates in DR5, a
fraction of which do not have imaging data associated with them in the
DR5 CAS database.  The purpose of DR supplemental is to make this
imaging data (FITS binary table catalogs of objects along with
corrected frames and auxillary flat file data) available to users
through a DAS-style interface.</p>

<p>We are now making available images and associated catalogs from
three categories of special runs.  They are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>A series of repeat runs (65 in all on both N and S strips) of
      the Equatorial Stripe in the Southern Galactic Cap (Stripe
      82);</li>
  <li>Scans through M31 and the Perseus Cluster;</li>
  <li>Scans taken at low Galactic latitude as part of the <a
      href="./aboutsegue.html">SEGUE</a> project; these runs were used
      to target stars on <a
      href="http://www.sdss.org/dr5/products/spectra/special.html">
      special plates</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is intended that DRsup offers access to the SDSS 
imaging runs associated with these plates.</p>

<p>Here is the <a
  href="../coverage/tssup.html">list of imaging
  runs available through DRsup</a>.</p>

<p>While only a subset of these runs are searchable in the CAS SQL
database (a subset of the SEGUE runs is available by querying the
<code>SEGUEDR6</code> database), they are available as part of a DAS
(Data Archive Server) for DRsup, this is a flat-file web-based file
server which allows retrieval via 'browser-tools' such as IE, Firefox
or command-line interfaces such as 'wget' or 'curl'.</p>

<p> Each DAS interface has a parallel DRsup
interface, including a <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DRsup-cgi-bin/FOOT">FOOTprint</a> server (is
a given coordinate included in the DRsup) and a <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DRsup-cgi-bin/DAS">DRsup retrieval
form</a>.</p>

<h3> User caution!</h3>

<p>Much of the data in DRsup is imaging at low Galactic latitude |b| &lt;
25 degrees, and as such, there are highly crowded fields, and regions
of high extinction.  These data were processed with the standard SDSS
photo pipelines.  Since these pipelines were not designed to work in
such crowded regions, the quality of the photometry in these areas is
not guaranteed to be accurate to the SDSS quoted limits of 2% in color
and r magnitude, nor is each and every crowded frame fully deblended;
i.e.  many fields are incompletely cataloged.  </p>


<p>Additionally, for the repeat stripe 82 scans, some scans were taken
in less than ideal seeing or photometric transparency, and the user is
cautioned to regard the quoted errors on objects with care. No attempt
was made to adjust the quoted errors to account for extinction,
crowded field photometry, slight non-photometric conditions or bad
seeing (FWHM &gt; 2.0 arcsec).  </p>

<!--<p>Quality plots and tables are available on a run-by-run and
field-by-field basis for <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DRsup/data/imaging/QA/summaryQA_analyzePC.html">DRsup</a>.
One may use the plots linked on the DRsup QA page to further determine
the quality of individual runs and fields within the runs.  See: <a
href="../products/qa/index.html">Photometry
QA</a> for more information on interpreting runQA.</p>-->

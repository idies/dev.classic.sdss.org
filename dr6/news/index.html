<h2> Bug in synthetic magnitudes of spectra: mag_0,mag_1,mag_2 --> u,g,r (not g,
r,i) </h2>

        There is a bug in the tabulating of synthetic magnitudes of objects
        based on their integrated, flux calibrated spectra convolved with
        the SDSS filter curves.  In the CAS table specObjAll (and its subset
        table specObj), the three quantities: mag_0, mag_1, and mag_2
        are intended to be the synthetic g, r, and i band magnitudes
        of each object.  In fact, in DR6 they are the 
        u, g, and r band synthetic magnitudes.  The wavelength
        coverage of the u band (centered on 3551 Angstroms) does 
        not overlap (except at the few percent level) the wavelength coverage
        of the spectrographs (which start at about 3800 Angstroms), and
        the synthetic u band is only a very rough estimate.  Thus, the 
        i synthetic magnitude is not directly available in the DR6 
        CAS database.  

        <p>
 If you currently need access to the i band synthetic magnitude, 
        they are currently only available in the DR6 DAS:  

        You may find them in HDU# 7 of the spPlate-$plate-$mjd.fits
        file in the form of a 640x5 (row x col) size image extension
	table containing the u,g,r,i,z synthetic magnitudes for 
	all 640 objects with spectra, in fiber number order 
	(i.e. the first 5 numbers are for the ugriz synthetic mags 
	for the object at fiber#1, etc).

        You may download the full spPlate-$plate-$mjd.fits file from 
        the DAS and extract this 'imaging region' from HDU#7 to access 
        these numbers.

        The u and z synthetic magnitudes are generally not to be used since,
        as mentioned above, the overlap of the wavelength coverage of the
        spectrographs with these filter bandpasses is minimal.

        <p>
        Note that the DR5 CAS has correct g,r,i synthetic values 
        in mag_0,mag_1,mag_2, however, an older version of the 
        spectroscopic pipeline was used to process these data 
        and the handling of reddening is different.
 Also note that the synthetic magnitude values may need an 
        AB correction applied to put them onto the SDSS gri system.

        <p>

        The spSpec-$mjd-$plate-$fiber.fit files have header keywords
        MAG_G, MAG_R, MAG_I which are intended to be the same as
        mag_0, mag_1, mag_2 in the specObjAll table of the CAS.
        These synthetic numbers are also 'shifted by one filter'
        in DR6, thus, they actually are
        synthetic mags u, g and r (instead of g,r, and i) respectively.

        <p>
        Please note this bug.

        It will be corrected for the DR7 release of the
        DAS and CAS.

<h3>Patch applied to DR6</h3>
 This patch, applied the week of Aug 27,2007, corrects several
  bugs in the database.
The list of patches to DR6 is as follows:

<ol>
	<li> 6 segments in Stripe 36 had a bug in their
	startMu/endMu, resulting in ~1500 duplicate primary
	objects in the main database.  This has been corrected,
	and the previously duplicate primaries have been made 
	secondary.

	<li> The 'Propermotions' table has been incremented for BESTDR6 from
	DR5 to the full DR6 dataset.  Additionally, propermotions have
	been added for a large number of objects which previously
	had been missed because they were targeted as galaxies (but turned
	out to be stars).  Additionally, propermotions have
	been added for Segue imaging to the SEGUEDR6 database context
	in a parallel propermotions table.
	Note that all these propermotions have been
	're-zeropointed' from their USNO-B source by matching to 	
	the SDSS positions for objects with zero proper motion (distant
	galaxies and quasars), and thus are of overall higher accuracy than
	those in the 'USNO' table. 

	<li> The 'Match' and 'MatchHead' tables in the CAS,
	which connects duplicate measurements of the
	same physical object on the sky, observed at
	different times (for instance, objects in the overlap
	between scanlines), were incompletely populated prior 
	to Aug 31, 2007.  They have now been updated.

	<li> The sppParams table incorrectly computed the derived
	parameter velgal (the velocity of a star in
	the Galactic frame of reference, subtracting out
	the suns motion of (v_x,v_y,v_z) = (7,224,10) km/s
	prior to Aug 31, 2007.  The table is now correct.
	The velgal velocities now also reflect the 7.3 km/s offset 
	determined by absolute reference to known globular clusters
	and other Radial velocity standards. The best
	radial velocity for stars in the DR6 dataset is the 
	'rva' value in the sppParams table.  It is reliable when
	the rvaerr is strictly > 0.

	<li> A view (subset) of the sppParams table, called 'spbsparams'
	has been generated for easy access to Galaxy spectral parameters,
	including redshift (along with redshift confidence) and 
	velocity dispersion (measured two different ways).  These
	parameters are available on a plate-by-plate basis
	in the DAS as part of the spZbest* binary FITS tables, and on a
	fiber-by-fiber basis in the spSpec* FITS spectra as header
	keywords, but they are gathered here in a SQL searchable table.

	<li> Documentation has been updated on matching photometry to
	spectroscopy on the <a href=http://segue.uchicago.edu/getstarted.html>SEGUE</a>
	website.  Magnitudes in the sppParams table are 'PSF target' magnitudes,
	the best available at the time an object was targetted for
	spectroscopic followup.  Since then, the imaging data for
	an object may be remeasured (recorded as the best photometry).
	Finally, ubercal photometry is also available for many
	objects.

	<li> The prepackaged tarballs of spectra, organized by object
	category (galaxy, qso, star, etc), are now available again,
	and include updates for <a href="../products/spectra/getspectra.html">DR6</a>.

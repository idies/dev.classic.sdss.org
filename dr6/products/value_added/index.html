  <li><b>SDSS Unusual BAL Quasars</b> A sample of 23 unusual Broad
      Absorption Line Quasars has been assembled from both the SDSS EDR and
      some post-EDR data, totalling approximately 8000 quasar spectra. No
      further examples of the five categories of unusual BAL quasars
      discussed in the paper could be found among the data inspected, at
      least for spectra with SNR at least 6 per pixel in at least one of the
      g, r, or i bands (see section 4 of the paper). The paper also presents
      a revised balnicity index for deciding whether a quasar is a BAL
      quasar or not.

      <p>Calibrated SDSS and followup spectra of all 23 objects, plus
      IRAF and SM code for calculating the traditional and revised balnicity
      indices, are available in a gzipped tar file.</p>

  <li>The <b><a
      href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/ivezic/sdssmoc/sdssmoc.html">3rd
      release of the SDSS Moving
      Object Catalog (MOC)</a></b> lists astrometric and
      photometric data for 204,305 moving objects observed prior to June
      2004. Of those, 67,637 are linked to 43,424 unique objects from
      the <a href="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.html">ASTORB file</a>, and their orbital
      elements are also listed. This is a cumulative release, and it
      supersedes the previous versions (<a
      href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/ivezic/sdssmoc/sdssmoc1.html">first
      MOC release</a> and <a

      combined with a density enhancement algorithm to detect clusters
      of galaxies. The SDSS CE galaxy cluster catalog contains an
      estimated redshift and richness for each cluster found in 350
      sq. deg. of SDSS commissioning data.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc/">NYU Value-Added
      Galaxy Catalog</a></b> The NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC)
      is a cross-matched collection of galaxy catalogs, including the
      SDSS, maintained for the study of galaxy formation and evolution. It
      includes carefully constructed large-scale structure samples useful
      for calculating power spectra, etc, and includes, e.g., the &quot;LSS
      Sample12&quot; described in various Blanton et al. and Tegmark
      et al. SDSS papers.  The SDSS data used have been reduced independently from the
      official SDSS reductions included in DR2/DR3, especially in photometric
      calibration, but the differences are minor.  There is also a
      page describing the results of <a
      href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/lf.html">Blanton et al.'s
      determination of the SDSS galaxy luminosity function</a>.</li>

  <li>The <b><a href="http://frank.phyast.pitt.edu/dr3/">CMU-PITT SDSS
      Value Added Catalog (VAC) database</a></b> is a database which
      allows users to conduct scientific
      analyses on the SDSS spectroscopic galaxy data. It allows for
      easy use of spectral information (i.e. emission line-widths),
      and for anybody to upload Science Derivatives for SDSS
      galaxies.</li>

  <li>The <b><a
      href="http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR4/">MPA/JHU
      value-added galaxy catalog</a></b> contains results from a custom galaxy
      spectral fitting code (line fluxes, continuum indices (raw, emission
      line subtracted, from best-fit model and interpolated to remove
      effects from sky lines), line widths, EWs etc.)  mostly written
      by Christy Tremonti and described in <a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ApJ...613..898T">Tremonti
      et al (2004)</a>.  In addition, the following types of derived data are
      also available:<ul>
	<li>Stellar masses following the precepts of <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003MNRAS.341...33K">Kauffmann
	    et al. (2003)</a></li>
	<li>Star formation rates following <a
	    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004MNRAS.351.1151B">Brinchmann
	    et al. (2004)</a></li>
	<li>Gas-phase metallicities as in <a
	    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ApJ...613..898T">Tremonti
	    et al (2004)</a></li>
      </ul>
      Finally, the MPA/JHU group has correlated the SDSS to the HST
      Exposure Time Catalogues and provide files for matching to
      the above spectroscopic data as well as the DR4 imaging.
  </li>

  <li>The <b><a
      href="http://photo.astro.princeton.edu/oriondatarelease/">SDSS
      Orion data release</a></b> contains imaging near the Galactic plane
      outside of the nominal survey boundaries. These additional data
      were obtained during commissioning
      and subsequent testing of the SDSS observing system, and they provide
      unique wide-area imaging data in regions of high obscuration and star
      formation, including numerous young stellar objects, Herbig-Haro
      objects and young star clusters. Because these data are outside the
      Survey regions in the Galactic caps, they are not part of the standard
      SDSS data releases. This public release of about 470
      square degrees includes the star-forming region NGC 2068/NGC
      2071/HH24 and a large part of Barnard's loop.</li>

  <li>The <b><a href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">Princeton spectra</a></b>
      are an alternate reduction of the DR1 spectra. The 2d reductions
      are essentially identical, but the determination of redshifts
      and classifications uses an independent code doing direct
      chi-squared fitting of templates to spectra.</li>

  <li>The <b><a href="http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa">SuperCOSMOS
      Science Archive</a></b> holds the object catalog data extracted
      from scans of photographic Schmidt survey plates of the southern
      sky. The SSA catalog includes links to cross-identifications
      from the SDSS EDR and DR1, USNO-B and 2MASS final data release
      catalogs.</li>

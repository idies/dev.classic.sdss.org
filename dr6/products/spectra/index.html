<h2>DR6 contains completely reprocessed spectra</h2>

<p>In DR6, there have been substantial improvements to the algorithms
which photometrically calibrate the spectra, and all spectra have been
re-reduced. The new spectro "rerun number" is 25.</p>

<h2>About spectroscopic samples</h2>

<h3>Normal survey plates</h3>

<p>The spectroscopic survey is predominantly a survey for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bright galaxies, the "main" sample, with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band
    magnitude &lt; 17.77 (to get an idea of their distribution, see
      this <a href="./pieplot.ps">pie plot showing the redshift
      distribution of 78275 DR1 galaxies with
      -15&deg; &lt; DEC &lt; 20&deg;</a>).</li>
  <li>Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band magnitude
    down to 19.5 (see this <a href="./zdist.ps">redshift distribution
      of DR2 "main" galaxies and LRGs</a>), and</li>
  <li>Quasars, targetting  quasar candidates as faint as <var>i &lt;
      20.2</var> (see this <a href="./qsozdist.ps">DR2 quasar
      redshift distribution</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a large number of spectra of stars. Brown dwarfs, ROSAT and
FIRST counterparts are targetted as well. Refer to the <a
href="../general/target_quality.html">target selection quality</a> or <a
href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithm</a> for
details about the spectroscopic survey targets.</p>

<h3>Extra and special plates, including SEGUE</h3>

<p>New since DR4 is the publication of &quot;extra&quot; and
&quot;special&quot; plates. <strong>Extra plates</strong> are repeat
observations of normal survey plates. These have the same plate number
as the original observation, but a different MJD and usually <em>a
different mapping between fiber number and
ra,dec</em>. <strong>Special plates</strong> are spectroscopic
observations made under a variety of special programs which are
described on the <a href="./special.html">special spectra
page</a>.</p>

<p>Note the caveat below about <a href="#specialquery">querying
 special-plate data in the CAS (including SEGUE)</a>.</p>


<h2>Getting and using spectra</h2>

<p>The spectra distributed by the SDSS have been sky subtracted,
corrected for telluric absorption <a
href="../../algorithms/spectrophotometry.html">spectrophotometrically
calibrated</a> by the Spectro2d pipeline.  Spectral classification,
redshift determination, and emission and absorption line measurements
are carried out by the &quot;1D&quot; pipeline. DR6 for the first time
contains the outputs from two independent 1D pipelines: the
<code>spectro1d</code> code that has also been used in all previous
releases, and the <a
href="../algorithms/redshift_type.html#specBS"><code>specBS</code></a>
code whose outputs (&quot;Princeton reductions&quot;) were previously
available only from <a
href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">spectro.princeton.edu</a>. The CAS
contains only the <code>spectro1d</code> outputs as before; the
<code>specBS</code> outpus are available through the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">DAS</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../../algorithms/index.html">algorithms page</a>
contains details about spectroscopic data processing for all pipelines.</p>

<p>Since DR1, the Data Archive Server has been providing the same spectrum in two
files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spectro2d <code>spPlate*.fits</code>:
      all calibrated spectra and supporting data (signal-to-noise,
      resolution, quality flags and similar) from a single plate,
      without any parameters or continuum fits. <strong>New in
      DR6:</strong> the spPlate files now also contain the sky spectra
      that have been used for sky subtraction of each spectrum.<br />
      See the <a
    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spPlate.html"><code>spPlate*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents. There is one <code>2d</code>
      directory for every plate number in the DAS that contains all
      <code>spPlate</code> files for that plate, including those for
      different MJDs where repeats are available; e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/2d_25/0644/">http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/2d_25/0644/</a></li>
  <li>Spectro1d <code>spSpec*.fits</code>:
      multiple fits extensions (images and tables) with the calibrated
      spectrum, a continuum-subtracted spectrum, and all measured parameters
      (redshift, line fits, line indices, per-pixel resolution). See
      the <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html"><code>spSpec*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents, and <a
      href="./read_spSpec.html">how to read an spSpec file</a>. There
      is one spSpec file per plate/MJD/fiber combination, found in a
      parallel <code>1d</code>directory tree with one directory
      per plate, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/1d_25/0644/1d/">http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/1d_25/0644/1d/</a></li>
  <li>In addition, spectro1d produces <code>spPlot*.gif,.ps</code>
      plots of the spectra with line locations for the best-fitting
      redshift, again in one directory per plate, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/1d_25/0644/gif/">http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/1d_25/0644/gif/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above files are available through the <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS query form</a>.</p>

<p>DR6 provides additional spectroscopic data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectro2d <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spCFrame.html"><code>spCFrame*.fits</code></a>:
      SDSS spectra are typically combined from 3 or more individual
      exposures of 15 minutes each. The individual flux-calibrated
      spectrograph exposures are available in spCFrame*.fits
      files. <strong>They contain spectra in the spectrograph's native
      wavelength mapping, which is neither linear in wavelength nor
      log-wavelength.</strong><br />
  </li>

  <li><a
  href="../../algorithms/redshift_type.html#specBS"><code>specBS</code></a>
  outputs (&quot;Princeton reductions&quot;; see <a
  href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">http://spectro.princeton.edu</a>):
      
      <ul>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZbest.html"><code>spZbest*.fits</code></a>:
	    best-fit classification and redshift for a given
	    spectrum</li>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZall.html"><code>spZall*.fits</code></a>:
	    Same structure aas spZbest, but contains all attempted
	    fits</li>
	<li><a
	    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spZline.html"><code>spZline*.fits</code></a>:
	    emission-line measurements</li>
      </ul>
      There is one file of each type for every plate/MJD
      combination.</li>
  <li><code>sspp</code> stellar parameter pipeline outputs: Most of
      these outputs are available only through two new  tables in the CAS:
      <ul>
	<li>Line index equivalent widths for stars:
	    <a href="./spectrolineindices.html">sppLines</a></li>
	<li>Stellar atmospheric parameters ([Fe/H], log g, Teff) for stars:
	    <a href="./spectroparameters.html">sppParams</a>
	    for all the <a href="../../start/aboutsegue.html">SEGUE</a>
	    spectra and a large fraction of the main
	    database spectra classified as stars (not galaxies or quasars).
	</li>
      </ul>
      In the DAS, we provide bulk versions of the stellar parameter
      outputs in one directory per plate/MJD combination, e.g. <a
      href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/sspp_25/0644-52149">DR6/data/spectro/sspp_25/0644-52149</a>,
      which include .csv  versions of the sppParams and sppLines
      tables and some additional information and plots not available through the
      CAS.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The specBS outputs are available through the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS query form</a>. The
<code>spCFrame</code> files are not available through the DAS query
form, but can be found in the same <code>2d</code> directories as the
<code>spPlate</code> files in the DAS; these also contain the specBS
outputs. E.g., <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/2d_25/0644/">http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/spectro/2d_25/0644/</a>.</p>

<h3>More on data access</h3>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to get spectra by coordinates, or to search for spectra by
redshift, object magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve them from the
archive. In particular, the <a
href="../../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> provides
a fast search capability for object lists and spectroscopic parameters
as well as pointers to the files in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">Data Archive Server</a>, whose
structure is explained on the <a href="../../data/index.html">Data
Archive Server structure and contents page</a>. The <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro Query
Server</a> query form is dedicated to the search of the spectroscopic
database. You can also download fits tables with the classification,
redshifts and other information from the <a
href="./getspectra.html">page with redshift catalogs and
spectro+imaging data</a>.</p>

<p>Please note the <a href="#caveats">caveats</a> below, which are
essential to obtain meaningful scientific results from analysing SDSS
spectra, in particular the <a href="#zstatus">redshift status
caveat</a>.</p>

<h3> Imaging information associated with each spectrum</h3>

<p> Very often one wishes to obtain all the SDSS photometric (imaging
camera) data associated with each spectrum.  One can obtain this
information most easily for nearly all plates through the <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">SQS</a>
interface by selecting imaging parameters to return with your selected
spectra.</p>

<p>For those who prefer working with the full fits files of spectra
and imaging catalogs, make available a special set of files
(<code>spObj-*.fit</code>) containing a bundled version of the
spectroscopic data and all the corresponding imaging data.</p>

<p>These files are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish. To get these files in bulk for the entire survey, see the <a
href="./getspectra.html">page on getting redshift catalogs and SDSS spectra
and corresponding imaging data</a>.</p>

<a name="caveats"></a>
<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h3> Bug in synthetic magnitude tabulation in DR6 CAS</h3>

<p>
<a name="synthmags"></a>
 There is a bug in the tabulating of synthetic magnitudes of objects
        based on their integrated, flux calibrated spectra convolved with
        the SDSS filter curves.  In the CAS table specObjAll (and its subset
        table specObj), the three quantities: mag_0, mag_1, and mag_2
        are intended to be the synthetic g, r, and i band magnitudes
        of each object.  In fact, in DR6 they are the
        u, g, and r band synthetic magnitudes.  The wavelength
        coverage of the u band (centered on 3551 Angstroms) does
        not overlap (except at the few percent level) the wavelength coverage
        of the spectrographs (which start at about 3800 Angstroms), and
        the synthetic u band is only a very rough estimate.  Thus, the
        i synthetic magnitude is not directly available in the DR6
        CAS database.

        <p>
 	If you currently need access to the i band synthetic magnitude,
        they are currently only available in the DR6 DAS:  

        You may find them in HDU# 7 of the spPlate-$plate-$mjd.fits
        file in the form of a 640x5 (row x col) size image extension
        table containing the u,g,r,i,z synthetic magnitudes for
        all 640 objects with spectra, in fiber number order
        (i.e. the first 5 numbers are for the ugriz synthetic mags
        for the object at fiber#1, etc).

        You may download the full spPlate-$plate-$mjd.fits file from
        the DAS and extract this 'imaging region' from HDU#7 to access
        these numbers.

        The u and z synthetic magnitudes are generally not to be used since,
        as mentioned above, the overlap of the wavelength coverage of the
        spectrographs with these filter bandpasses is minimal.

 	<p>
        Note that the DR5 CAS has correct g,r,i synthetic values
        in mag_0,mag_1,mag_2, however, an older version of the
        spectroscopic pipeline was used to process these data
        and the handling of reddening is different.
 	Also note that the synthetic magnitude values may need an
        AB correction applied to put them onto the SDSS gri system.

        <p>

        The spSpec-$mjd-$plate-$fiber.fit files have header keywords
        MAG_G, MAG_R, MAG_I which are intended to be the same as
        mag_0, mag_1, mag_2 in the specObjAll table of the CAS.
        These synthetic numbers are also 'shifted by one filter'
        in DR6, thus, they actually are
        synthetic mags u, g and r (instead of g,r, and i) respectively.

        <p>

        It will be corrected for the DR7 release of the
        DAS and CAS.
        <p>


<h3> Bug in Primtarget Flag in many SEGUE spectra </h3>
<p>
<a name="primtarget"></a>

The Primtarget flag in many SEGUE spectra, as well as in many 'south22'
program plates, is truncated, so that the trailing digit is missing
and the whole of the number is shifted down by a factor of 10.
Thus, a Primtarget of -2147483584 is listed in the CAS database as
-214748358.  This will be corrected in DR7 release. The correct
values of this field may be found in HDU#5 of the spPlate files
in the DAS.

<a name="specphotooffset"></a>
<h3>Offset in spectrophotometric flux scale for 28 plate/MJD combinations in
DR6</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./specphotooffset.html"-->

<a name="zstatus"></a>
<h3>Redshift status</h3>

<p> Only 1% of the objects have an "unknown" classification, usually
because of low signal-to-noise ratio or completely featureless
spectra. The redshifts of all but a few tenths of a percent of the
remainder are believed to be correct. <strong>To identify the few
objects with unreliable redshifts, be sure to consider the confidence
we have assigned to each redshift (<code>z_conf</code> in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html">spSpec*.fits primary header</a>,
and the status <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zstatus"><code>zStatus</code></a>
and <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zwarning"><code>zWarnin</code></a>
of the redshift measurement, which may have failed.</strong>). A
useful cut on the redshift confidence is <code>z_conf &gt; 0.35</code>
(or <code>zConf &gt; 0.35</code> in the SQL database).

<h3>Zero equivalent width of emission lines, especially H alpha</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./zeroEW.html"-->

<a name="chunk78"></a>
<h3>Main survey spectra which are not marked <code>sciencePrimary =
1</code> in CAS</h3>

<p>Due to a bug in the pipelines, there are no <a
href="../dm/flatFiles/tsTargets.html">tsTargets*.fits</a> files for
plates 1617-1620, and 1623. As a consequence, the objects from
this plates do not have entries in the <code>target</code> and
<code>targetInfo</code> tables in the CAS.  Hence they are not marked
<code>sciencePrimary = 1</code> and do not appear in the default
<code>specObj</code> and <code>specPhoto</code> views, which provide a
filtered set of unique science spectra and form the basis of all
query interfaces. Use the <code>specObjAll</code> and and
<code>specPhotoAll</code> tables to access spectra from these plate
in the CAS.</p>

<a name="extinct"></a>
<h3>Galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./galextinction.html"-->

<h3>Night sky emission lines</h3>

<p>The night sky emission lines at 5577&Aring, (when there is auroral
activity) at 6300&Aring;, 6363&Aring;, and in the OH forest in the red
can be very strong, and leave significant residuals in the spectra
whose amplitude is occasionally underestimated by the noise model.  Be
cautious about interpreting the reality of weak features close to
these lines.</p>

<a name="badplates"></a>
<h3>Plates with not-quite-perfect spectrophotometry</h3>

<p>A small number of plates, given in the <a href="badplates.txt">list
of not-quite-perfect plates</a>, suffered from a variety of minor
problems.  The CCD frames for several plates suffered from a transient
electronic problem in the red camera in Spectrograph 2, causing the
columns of the CCD to be misaligned on readout.  This was fixed in
software, and we believe the data to be reliable.  Another set of
plates labeled &quot;Spectrograph Collimation Problem&quot; suffered
from having the spectrograph collimator improperly focused.  This
problem caused a mismatch between the flatfields and the science
exposure instrumental profile shapes on the CCD in both the spatial
and wavelength directions, causing the optimal extraction process to
reject an excessive number of pixels.  This problem was fixed in
software, and comparing overlapping objects from adjacent plates
confirms that the redshifts from these problematic plates are
unbiased.  However, the spectra themselves should not be used for
precision work or spectrophotometry.  Other plates have individual
problems as noted. E.g., during the exposure of one plate, light from
an LED somewhere on the telescope found its way to the spectrographs,
resulting in an artificial excess of light centered roughly at
6500&Aring;; the spectrophotometry of this plate is quite poor.</p>

<a name="specphotomismatch"></a>
<h3>Mismatches between spectra and photometric data</h3>

<p>In a few cases, the fiber mapping failed which identifies which
fiber has been plugged into which hole. When this happens for two or
more objects on the sample plate, there is the possibility of wrong
matches between spectra and photometric objects. There are 123 objects
for which the mapping between object and spectrum cannot be
established (&quot;unmapped fibers&quot;); their ra/dec is listed as
-9999 in the spectroscopic data set but synthetic fiber magnitudes
(<code>mag_0, mag_1, mag_2</code> in the <code>specObj</code> tables
in the CAS, <code>mag_g, mag_r, mag_i</code> in the
<code>spSpec*.fit</code> files) greater than 0 (i.e., use the
synthetic magnitudes to distinguish the unmapped fibers from the 2221
fibers which were broken completely at the time of observations and
did not yield a spectrum at all).</p>

<p>Errors in the deblending algorithm in the <code>target</code> reductions
caused spectroscopy to be carried out occasionally on non-existent
objects (e.g., diffraction spikes of bright stars or satellite
trails).  Many of these objects no longer exist in the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions with its improvements to the deblender.  In other
cases, the photometric pipeline timed out during the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions in fields for which <code>target</code> imaging proceeded
without problem, so that the <code>best</code> photometry is missing for
bona-fide objects. This predominantly happens in fields close to a few
very bright stars.  We expect to recover objects from these ``timeout
holes'' in future data releases.</p>

<a name="specialquery"></a>
<p>The <a href="./special.html">special plates</a> have special issues
regarding photometric matches. Some of the special plates were
targeted using photometry that is not part of DR6, or not even SDSS
photometry.  Therefore, the SDSS photometry for objects on plates 797,
1468, 1471, 1472, 1665, and 1666 is only available through <a
href="../../start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, special plates with SDSS photometry are different from
regular SDSS plates in that they have no tiling information associated
with them. Therefore, the <code>specPhotoAll</code> table is not
populated with all entries from special plates.  Moreover, the SEGUE
low-latitude scans are loaded into a separate database
<code>SEGUEDR6</code> in the CAS in order to keep <code>BESTDR6</code>
a homogeneous database of the high-latitude extragalactic
sky. Querying SEGUE data is explained in a <a
href="http://segue.uchicago.edu/getstarted.html#ex4">SEGUE sample SQL
query</a>.</p>

<p>To obtain photometric information for non-SEGUE special-plate
spectra, perform the following join:</p>
<pre>
select columns
from specObjAll as so
inner join photoObj as po on so.bestobjid = po.objid</pre>

<p>

<!-- <p>A total of 663 spectroscopic objects therefore do not have a -->
<!-- counterpart in the <code>best</code> catalogs, 0.2% of the total.  Of -->
<!-- these, 80 (including the 62 unmapped fibers) can only be retrieved -->
<!-- from the table <code>specObjAll</code> in the database.  The remaining -->
<!-- 583 objects are contained in the default spectroscopic table -->
<!-- <code>specObj</code>, but will not be found by queries requesting both -->
<!-- photometric and spectroscopic information.</p> -->

<h3>Galaxy velocity dispersion measurements</h3>

<p>The velocity dispersion measurements distributed with SDSS spectra
use template spectra convolved to a maximum sigma of 420
km/s. Therefore, velocity dispersion sigma &gt; 420 km/s are not
reliable and must not be used. The figure below shows the quality of
velocity dispersion error estimates.<p>

<div class="cfig"> <img width="475px" src="../../algorithms/vdisp_errcomp.png"> <p

measurements from spectro1d DR6 (thin black solid line), spectro1d DR5
(dotted red line), specBS (dashed blue line), and B03 (dotted-dashed

measurements.</p> </div>

<p></p>

<p>We recommend the user to not use SDSS velocity dispersion measurements
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectra with median per-pixel S/N &lt; 10</li>
  <li>velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70 km s<sup>-1</sup>
    given the typical S/N and the instrumental resolution of the SDSS
  spectra</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that the velocity dispersion measurements are not corrected to a
standard relative circular aperture.</p>

<p>Their corresponding <code>target</code>imaging data does not
contain any <code>PRIMARY</code> objects. Objects from this region are
therefore not available via a normal search of the <code>target</code>
object lists.  To find the target data, select on <code>status &
0x402</code> (both <code>GOOD</code> and <code>OK_SCANLINE</code>)
instead of selecting on the <code>PRIMARY</code> flag being set in
<code>status</code>. The information is also contained in the
<code>spObj-*.fit</code> files, which are available for all plates.
These files are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish.  They are also available for bulk <a
href="../../data/rsync.html">rsync</a> or <a
href="http://wget.sunsite.dk">wget</a> download via <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR6/data/">DAS through http </a> (in
<code>spectro/ss_SPRERUN/PLATE/spObj-*</code>).</p>

<p>These objects have been declared <code>primary</code> in the
<code>best</code> data set.  The CAS correctly records the positional
matches between these spectra and their counterparts in
<code>best</code>. However, since the corresponding targets are not
primary, the spectra are not included in the <code>specObj</code> and
<code>specPhoto</code> views in the CAS, but must be searched
explicitly in <code>specObjAll</code> and
<code>photoObjAll</code>.</p>

<h2>About SDSS object lists</h2>

<p>The calibrated object lists reports positions, fluxes, and shapes
of all objects detected at &gt;5 sigma on the survey
images. Photometry is reported on the natural system of the <a
href="../../glossary/index.html#APO">APO</a> 2.5m survey telescope (a
system which includes 1.3 airmasses at APO; see description of <a
href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html">photometric flux calibration</a>)
in <a href="../../glossary/index.html#asinh">asinh magnitudes</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting and using object lists</h2>

<p><strong>You need to look at the <a href="./flags.html">object
      flags</a> in the object lists to obtain meaningful
      results.</strong></p>

<p>Calibrated object lists are stored in two file types in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">Data Archive Server</a>:
<ul>
  <li><p><a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/tsObj.html"><code>tsObj*.fits</code></a>
      containing the object lists themselves. There is one file
      per <a
      href="../../glossary/index.html#field">field</a>. The files
      are binary fits tables with one row per object.
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>The primary header of <code>tsObj</code> files contains
	    some parameters applying to the entire field, such as the
	    seeing (but also see the PSF parameters in the
	    <code>tsField</code> file below).</li>
	<li>The reported magnitudes are corrected for atmospheric
	    extinction (compare <a
	    href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html#counts2mag">converting
	    counts to magnitudes)</a>, but not for Galactic
	    extinction. The Galactic extinction
	    for each object as derived from <a
	    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel,
	    Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998)</a> dust maps is reported as
	    <code>reddening</code>. The <a
	    href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithms</a>
	    use magnitudes corrected for both kinds of extinction.</li>
      </ul>

      includes an <a href="./read_tsObj.sm">illustrative SM
      script to filter tsObj files</a> and
      explanations of which flags to check.</p></li>
  <li><a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/tsField.html"><code>tsField*.fits</code></a>
      files, with one row of
      parameters relevant to the entire field. This includes the
      average PSF profile, e.g.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/fpAtlas.html"><code>fpAtlas*.fits</code></a>
files contain "postage-stamp"
images, the set of pixels determined to belong to each object.
See <a href="../images/read_atlas.html">how to read an atlas
image</a>.  </p>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to search the object lists by coordinates, magnitude,
color etc., and to retrieve data from the archive.  In particular, the
<a href="../../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a>
provides a fast search capability for object lists and spectroscopic
parameters as well as pointers to the files in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">Data Archive Server</a>.  The <a
href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/IQS.asp">Imaging
Query Server</a> query form is dedicated to the search of the imaging
database.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<a name="highpmstars"></a>
<h3>Missing high proper-motion stars in SDSS DR6 and before</h3>
<!--#include virtual="./missinghighpmstars.html"-->

<a name="cav_lowlat"></a>
<h3>Incomplete and/or inaccurate photometry at low galactic latitudes</h3>

<p>Much of the data in SEGUE and <a
href="../../start/aboutdrsup.html">DRsup</a> is imaging at low
Galactic latitude |b| &lt; 25 degrees, and as such, there are highly
crowded fields, and regions of high extinction. These data were
processed with the standard SDSS photo pipelines. Since these
pipelines were not designed to work in such crowded regions, the
quality of the photometry in these areas is not guaranteed to be
accurate to the SDSS quoted limits of 2% in color and r magnitude, nor
is each and every crowded frame fully deblended; i.e. many fields are
incompletely cataloged.</p>

<h3>Proper motions are not correct</h3>
<a name="propermot"></a>

This affects the 'propermotions' table in the CAS for DR6:

<pre>

This catalog was published in the 
paper "An Improved Proper-Motion Catalog Combining USNO-B And
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey", Munn et al. 2004, AJ, 127, 3034.  The
proper motions are contained in the "ProperMotions" table in the CAS.

The bug itself involves an incorrect sign when interpreting residuals
in the USNO-B catalog; for those interested the details are given
below.  The results of the bug are as follows:

1) The proper motions in declination were unaffected by the bug, and
    are thus correct.

2) The proper motions in right ascension suffer from smoothly varying
    stematic errors of as much as 3 mas/yr, though more
    typically ~1-2 mas/year.  The systematic error is less than
    1 mas/year over 20% of the DR6 sky, and less than 2 mas/year over
    80% of the DR6 sky.

3) For objects which had a non-zero right ascension proper motion in
    USNO-B, the differences between the right ascension proper motions
    when correctly and incorrectly determined, after removing the
    systematic error, has a dispersion of only about 1 mas/year.  This
    is insignificant, since the known statistical errors in the proper
    motions are about 3.5 mas/year per coordinate.

4) In USNO-B, objects which had a proper motion consistent with 0 to
    within a few sigma were set to have a proper motion of exactly 0.
    For these objects, the dispersion between the correct and incorrect
    right ascension proper motions, after removing the systematic
    errors, is about 5 mas/year.  These motions are simply wrong, though
    their incorrect values are still consistent with zero, and thus
    selecting objects to have zero proper motion within some number of
    sigma should still mostly work.

Thus, for users working with samples of stars chosen to have
significantly detected proper motions, the impact of the bug should
be small.  The bug adds a systematic error of ~2 mas/year in right
ascension to objects with statistical errors of about 3.5 mas/year.
However, for users working closer to the statistical error limit, or
averaging over many stars to determine small mean motions, the
additional errors are clearly significant.  In particular, the proper
motions in right ascension of objects which were set to have an exactly
zero proper motion in USNO-B are unreliable (though still correctly
consistent with zero).  The use of the catalog in its current form for
Galactic structure work is severly impacted.

A corrected version of the catalog has been generated.  This will be
used to load the CAS for the next (DR7) data release. 

Please contact us if you require access to the corrected proper motions
table prior to the DR7 release.

<h3>Overestimation of sky levels in the vicinity of bright
objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./brightgalsky.html"-->

<a name="isoradii"></a>
<h3>Isophotal radii in DR3-DR6 are given in pixels, not arcseconds</h3>

<p>The isophotal radii of objects are supposed to be reported in
arcseconds, as they were in earlier data releases. Due to a
programming error, all isophotal radii are given in pixels in
DR3-DR6. To obtain the isophotal radii in arcseconds, scale by the
pixel size of 0.396 arcseconds.</p>

<p>The bug is present in both the <code>tsObj</code> files in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">DAS</a> and the
<code>photoObj</code> and derived tables in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#CAS">CAS</a>.</p>

<a name="AB"></a>
<h3>SDSS and AB magnitudes</h3>

<p>The SDSS photometry is intended to be on the AB system.  However,
this is known not to be exactly true. See <a
href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html#sdss2ab">Conversion from SDSS to
AB magnitudes</a> in the Flux calibration section of the Algorithm
descriptions.</p>

<a name="cav_skybright"></a>
<h3>Sky brightness values are extinction-corrected</h3>

<p>The various measures of sky brightness reported in the
<code>tsField</code> files are corrected for atmospheric extinction in
the same way as calibrated object magnitudes in <code>tsObj</code>
files. To do a correct <a
href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html#counts2mag">conversion from
magnitudes to counts and vice versa</a>, you need to treat object and
sky magnitudes in the same way.</p>

<a name="cav_skyunit"></a>
<h3>Sky brightness values are given in maggies, not magnitudes</h3>

<p>The various measures of sky brightness reported in the
<code>tsField</code> files are given in <a
href="../../glossary/index.html#maggie">maggies/square arcsecond</a> (as
in <code>tsObj</code> files), but the fits headers incorrectly give
magnitudes/square arcseconds as units.  Only <code>tsField</code>
files in the <code>TARGET</code> version of runs 94, 125, 1033 and
1056 still have the numbers in magnitudes.</p>

<a name="cav_objcounts"></a>
<h3>Object counts</h3>

<p>The <code>nobjects</code> etc. entries in <code>tsField</code>
files (<code>field</code> table in the CAS database) are currently
meaningless.</p>

<a name="cav_psfvsap"></a>
<h3>A few runs processed with slightly older version of photo</h3>
<p>
  As described in the DR2 paper, mis-estimates of the sky background
in the postage stamps of stars used for PSF determination occasionally
coupled with the PSF determination itself in early versions of the
photometric pipeline.  We were able to suppress this behavior by
explicitly forcing the sky-subtracted images to zero at their edges.
This revised code was run on most of the imaging runs included in DR2
and DR3, but not quite all of them.  In every case that was run with
the old code, a comparison of PSF and aperture photometry of stars
confirmed that there was no significant contribution to the PSF from
wrongly estimated sky, but the user should be aware that these runs have
not been reduced by the identical version of the pipeline.  The run/reruns
in question are: 1239/40, 1336/40, 1339/40, 1356/40, 1359/40, 1659/40, 1889/40, 
2075/40, 2076/40, 2248/40, 2305/40, 2328/40, 2335/40, 2662/40, 2738/40,
3538/40, 3704/40, 3723/40, 3894/40, 3905/40, 3909/40, 3910/40, 3919/40,
3927/30, 3325/41, and 3838/41.  These will be reprocessed and replaced
in the archive for a future data release.

<h3>Deblending of bright galaxies significantly improved since DR2</h3>

<p>The behavior of the deblender of overlapping images has been
further improved for DR2 and beyond; these changes are most important for
bright galaxies of large angular extent (&gt; 1').  In the EDR, and to
a lesser extent in the DR1, bright galaxies were occasionally
&quot;shredded&quot; by the deblender, i.e., interpreted as two or
more objects and taken apart.  With improvements in the code that
finds the center of large galaxies in the presence of superposed
stars, and the deblending of stars superposed on galaxies, this
shredding now rarely happens.  Indeed, inspections of several hundred
NGC galaxies shows that the deblend is correct in 95% of the cases;
most of the exceptions are irregular galaxies of various sorts.</p>

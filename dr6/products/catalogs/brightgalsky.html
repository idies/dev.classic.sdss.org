<p>Because of scattered light (see the <a
href="../algorithms/edrpaper.html">EDR paper</a> [<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123..485S">Stoughton
et al. 2002</a>]), the background sky in the SDSS images is
non-uniform on arc-minute scales.  The photometric pipeline determines
the median sky value within each 100&quot; square on a grid with
50&quot; spacing, and bilinearly interpolates this sky value to each
pixel.  This biases the sky bright near large extended galaxies, and
as was already reported in the DR4 paper and <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.361.1287M">(Mandelbaum
et al.  2005)</a>, causes a systematic decrease in the number density
of faint objects near bright galaxies. In addition, it also strongly
affects the photometry of the bright galaxies themselves, as has been
reported by <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...662..808L">Lauer et
al. (2007)</a>, <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133.1741B">Bernardi et
al. (2007)</a>, and <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...660.1186L">Lisker et
al. (2007)</a>.</p>

<p>We have quantified this effect by adding simulated galaxies (with
exponential or de Vaucouleurs) profiles to SDSS images. The simulated
galaxies ranged from apparent magnitude <var>m<sub>r</sub>=12</var> to
<var>m<sub>r</sub>=19</var> in half-magnitude steps, with a one-to-one
mapping from <var>m<sub>r</sub></var> to Sersic half-light radius
determined using the mean observed relation between these quantities
for Main sample galaxies with exponential and de Vaucouleurs profiles.
Axis ratios of <var>0.5</var> and <var>1</var> were used, with random
position angle for the non-circular simulated galaxies.  The results
in the <var>r</var> band are shown in the Figure, showing the
difference between the input magnitude and the model magnitude
returned by the SDSS photometric pipeline, as a function of
magnitude.</p>

<p>Also shown is the fractional error in the scale size
<var>r<sub>e</sub></var>.  The biases are significant to
<var>r=16</var> for late-type galaxies, and to <var>r=17.5</var> for
early-type galaxies.  Also shown is the results of a separate analysis
by by Hyde & Bernardi (unpublished) who fit deVaucouleurs models to
SDSS images of extended elliptical galaxies, using their own sky
subtraction algorithm, which is less likely to overestimate the sky
level near extended sources.  Their results are quite consistent with
the simulations.</p>

<h1>Sky coverage</h1>

<p>The DR1 contains that part of the SDSS imaging and spectroscopy taken before <font
color="red">such and such a date</font> satisfying the survey quality
requirements <font color="red">do we have a link to
those?</font>. Here we give coverage plots and the detailed <a
href="#tables">coverage tables</a> from which they were
constructed. The survey terms are explained in the sections on <a
href="#imaging">imaging coverage</a> and <a
href="#spectro">spectroscopic coverage</a> below.</p>

Also check the <a href="/~iraf/dr1/fc">SDSS finding chart</a> for
survey coverage.

<a name="imaging"></a><h2>Imaging coverage: stripes, runs, reruns</h2>

<p>Since the imaging survey scans along great circles on the sky, the
survey coverage is defined in <a
href="../glossary/glossary_alpha.html#great_circle_coords">great
circle coordinates</a>.  Great circles are labelled by an integer
stripe number <em>n</em> such that the inclination of a stripe with
respect to the celestial equator is -25&deg; + 2.5&deg; &times;
<em>n</em>. The coordinate along a stripe is called <em><a
href="../glossary/glossary_alpha.html#mu">mu</a></em>.  The DR1
coverage is therefore defined in terms of stripe number and
<em>mu</em>.</p>

<p>An imaging <em>run</em> designates a continuous scan of the imaging
telescope along a stripe. Since the camera's focal plane is not
completely filled with CCDs (see the <a
href="../instruments/index.html">instrument descriptions</a>), at
least two runs are required to completely cover one <em>stripe</em>.
A single run's contribution is called a <em>strip</em>. The imaging
data reduction is done on a run-by-run basis, hence the data in our <a
href="../data/index.html">Data Archive</a> are accessible by run
number.  A <em>run</em> is divided into images 2048 pix &times; 1489
pix which are called <em>fields</em>.  Object detection, photometry
and classification is done field by field.</p>

<p>Every time we (re)process our imaging data, we assign the outputs a
new <em>rerun</em> number. Across runs, this is an arbitrary index, so
the same rerun of different runs does not have to be produced with the
same software or calibrations.</p>

We publish two <em>reruns</em> for each <em>run</em>
contained in DR1:
<ol>
  <li>A <em>target</em> rerun, which is the reduction used to select
      targets for the spectroscopic survey. This is referred to as
      <code>skyVersion = 0</code>.</li>
  <li>A <em>best</em> rerun, which is the best available
      reduction. This is usually a different rerun from the
      <em>target</em> version, since our photometric pipelines have
      been evolving. The <em>best</em> rerun is referred to as
      <code>skyVersion = 1</code>.</li>
</ol>

There is one coverage table each for the target and best version. The
tables contain the following information:
<ul>
  <li>The survey area on the sky, given as a <em>stripe number</em>
      and a range for the <em>mu</em> coordinate (<code>startmu</code>
      &lt;= <em>mu</em> &lt;= <code>endmu</code>).  These were used
      to create the plots above.</li>
  <li>The <em>runs</em> and <em>reruns</em> and the range of
      <em>fields</em> which cover the given area.  This is the
      information needed to find data for a given part of the sky in
      the <a href="../data/index.html">Data archive</a>.</li>
</ul>

Notes
<ul>
  <li>In general, the <em>target</em> and <em>best</em> version of a
particular region of the sky come from the same run. However, there
are some exceptions which are explained in the <a
href="./targetvbest.html">list of runs differing for target and
best</a>.</li>
  <li>If it seems that other data are missing from some run, look at
      the <a href="./camcoldiffs.html">list of fields which are meant
      to be missing</a>.</li>
</ul>

<a name="spectro"></a><h2>Spectroscopy</h2>

The spectrograph's 640 fibers are distributed on a plug plate of
roughly 7&deg; diameter projected on sky. Spectroscopic coverage is
given in terms of the plate centers.  Plates are identified by a
unique number assigned during targetting and the MJD on which they
were observed, to distinguish re-observations of the same plate.

The file above defines the DR1 spectroscopic coverage. There is an
ASCII <a href="./spectrosummary.txt">plate summary</a> listing all
plates together with the numbers of objects of various categories
found.

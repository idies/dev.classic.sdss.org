<h1>The SDSS Data Release 1 (DR1)</h1>

<p>The DR1 data set is defined by imaging data obtained through July
2001 and the spectroscopic observations of the targets that were
selected from these imaging data.  The <a
href="http://arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305492">DR1 paper</a> (Abazajian
et al., AJ, submitted) gives a brief overview of the scope and data
quality of DR1. With this release, we are providing two access
tools. The <a href="../access/index.html">Data Archive Server
(DAS)</a> includes a set of links to the files produced by the imaging
and spectroscopic pipelines, and it also includes a web form that
allows limited ability to search the database and create catalogs. The
<a href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr1/en">Catalog Archive Server
(CAS)</a> is an SQL database of objects, loaded from the DAS files,
that provides extremely powerful search capabilities for the
construction of catalogs of astronomical objects.</p>

<p>We discovered just before the relase that the outputs of the
imaging pipeline contained a systematic offset between what we call
model magnitudes and Petrosian magnitudes of galaxies. Nevertheless,
the release went ahead because the SDSS Collaboration has published
more than a hundred papers in refereed journals that are based on data
files of the quality now released as DR1 (see the <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/publications/">SDSS publication list</a>).
The SDSS Collaboration is eager to let the astronomical community use
the current data because the quality is superb, despite the small set
of parameters that are problematic.  In summary, we have validated the
DR1 data with the following primary caveats:</p>

<!--model mag caveats have been moved to -->
<!--dr1web/products/catalogs/modelmagcaveat.html so they can be -->
<!--replicated easily in multiple pages. As side effect, must read -->
<!--this file through web server processing the following Server-side -->
<!--include directive to see the caveats in a browser.-->

<!--#include virtual="../products/catalogs/modelmagcaveat.html"-->

<p>The offset is now understood, and a complete reprocessing of the
data is under way with a new version of the software that provides
reliable model magnitudes.  This reprocessing will also take advantage
of improved flat fields.  The DR1 data, reprocessed with improved
software and better flat fields, will be part of the next data
release, Data Release 2 (DR2), scheduled for early 2004. This approach
will give the community faster access to a larger set of data
processed with the final version of the pipelines than an intermediate
release of only the DR1 data set.</p>

<p>SDSS is committed to public release of the survey data products.
Formal releases are made as the data are validated by the SDSS
Collaboration. The <a href="../glossary/index.html#edr">Early Data
Release</a> (EDR, <a href="../algorithms/edrpaper.html">Stoughton et
al. 2002</a>) published the early SDSS commissioning data.  DR1
includes a reprocessing of data in the EDR that pass our data-quality
criteria for the official survey. <strong>We recommend that users who
have used the EDR read the <a
href="../algorithms/dr1changes.html">description of changes from the
Early Data Release to Data Release 1 (DR1)</a> (see also the DR1 paper
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305492">Abazajian et
      al. 2003, AJ accepted; astro-ph/0305492</a>).</strong></p>

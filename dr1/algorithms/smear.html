<h1>Smear</h1>
<h2>What are smear observations?</h2>

<p>The smear observations are short (4 minute) spectroscopic observations made
while the telescope dithers such that the fibers map out a 5.5 x 9 arcsecond
box on the sky, with the long axis perpendicular to the horizon. They are
obtained once per plate plugging.</p>

<h2>Why are smears necessary?</h2>

<p>The smear observations are used in fluxing the spectra to correct
for light losses from the 3" fiber aperture. Light loss can be caused
by bad guiding, poor seeing, or bad fiber placement. All of these
problems are made even more onerous by atmospheric refraction, which
causes light from the science aperture to be displaced on the sky as a
function of wavelength. This effect is particularly significant for
the SDSS spectra because of their broad wavelength coverage (3800 -
9200 &Aring;).  At an airmass of 1.5 (the worst under which DR1
spectroscopy was obtained) the light at the ends of the spectrum is
dispersed by nearly 1/2 of the fiber aperture, causing potential
spectrophotometric errors.</p>

<h2>How are smears used?</h2>

<p>The Spectro2d pipeline utilizes the smears to help combine multiple
exposures that have been extracted and wavelength calibrated. Since
the individual frames may have been taken under very different
conditions their observed fluxes may not agree well -- a problem that
makes cosmic ray rejection difficult.  To remove the
exposure-to-exposure differences, the Spectro2d pipeline fits a third
order polynomial to the ratio of the smear exposure and each science
exposure for each fiber individually. These polynomials are then used
to correct the science exposures such that their low order spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) match that of the smear. For a given
spectrum, the net result is that the high frequency spectral features
come from the science exposures in the 3" aperture, but the low
frequency spectral shape and the total flux come from the 5.5" x 9"
smear exposure. The consequences of this for galaxies and stars are
quite different.</p>

<p>When smears are not available or of insufficient quality Spectro2d
uses the science observation with the highest S/N as a proxy for the
smear observation and proceeds in an identical manner. Thus, spectra
can be reduced with or without smears.  <i>Of the 290 spectroscopic
plates in the DR1 data set, 226 were calibrated using smear
observations. </i></p>

<h2>The Effects of Smear on Galaxies</h2>

<p>The use of smear exposures to calibrate stellar spectra helps to
recover lost light and thereby improves spectrophotometry.  However,
the situation is very different for galaxies, because they are
extended sources. The fraction of galaxy light contained within the 3"
fiber aperture is typically about 1/3 and rarely exceeds 1/2. Thus,
poor seeing and guiding cause the fiber to see slightly different
parts of the galaxy rather than simply causing light loss. Atmospheric
dispersion also acts differently since light is dispersed into the
fiber aperture from adjacent regions of the galaxy as well as out of
it. Moreover, there is a lot of variation from galaxy to galaxy, due
to the range of physical sizes, redshifts, surface brightness
profiles, and radial color gradients observed.</p>

<p>The most obvious effect of the smear calibration on galaxies, is
that the total flux of the spectrum increases since more light is
recovered by the larger smear aperture. This is demonstrated below, by
comparing magnitudes synthesized from the spectra with <a
href="./photometry.html#mag_fiber">fiber magnitudes</a> from the imaging
data. As expected, the increase in flux depends on the galaxy's
size.</p>

<p> The impact of the smear calibration on the colors of galaxy
spectra is even more important to understand since it affects the SEDs
of galaxies and their emission line ratios. One concern is that
galaxies are known to have radial color gradients. Unfortunately, the
gradients are expected to be pronounced in the most common galaxies in
the SDSS sample, namely spiral galaxies near L*, which harbor both a
significant bulge and disk component. Strong color gradients are
problematic, because the galaxy SEDs in the science and smear
apertures may be not be similar.  We have tested this by reducing the
DR1 spectra with and without smear. The results are shown below.</p>

<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100" align="center">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><img src="./gal_smear_compare.jpg" alt="comparison of galaxy colors with and without smear" width="540" height="360">
      <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Difference between the (g-r) colors of galaxies with
and without the smear calibration applied. The grey scale represents the
number of galaxies in each bin. <br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Many galaxies are virtually unaffected by smear, especially red galaxies.
However it is clear that smear can change the colors of some galaxy spectra
substantially. This should be considered when undertaking scientific programs
requiring high spectrophotometric precision.</p>

<p><strong>In future data releases the smear calibrations will not be used on 
galaxies.</strong></p>

<h2>About spectroscopic samples</h2>

<p>The spectroscopic survey is predominantly a survey for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bright galaxies, the "main" sample, with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band
    magnitude &lt; 17.77 (see this <a href="./pieplot.ps">pie plot
      showing the redshift distribution of 78275 DR1 galaxies with
      -15&deg; &lt; DEC &lt; 20&deg;</a>).</li>
  <li>Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band magnitude
    down to 19.5 (see this <a href="./zdist.ps">redshift distribution
      of DR1 "main" galaxies and LRGs</a>), and</li>
  <li>Quasars, targetting  quasar candidates as faint as <var>i &lt;
      20.2</var> (see this <a href="./qsozdist.ps">DR1 quasar
      redshift distribution</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a large number of spectra of stars. Brown dwarfs, ROSAT and
FIRST counterparts are targetted as well. Refer to the <a
href="../general/target_quality.html">target selection quality</a> or <a
href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithm</a> for
details about the spectroscopic survey targets.</p>

<h2>Getting and using spectra</h2>

<p>The spectra distributed by the SDSS have been sky subtracted,
corrected for telluric absorption (which effectively also corrects for
galactic extinction; see <a href="#extinct">extinction note</a>
below), and <a
href="../../algorithms/spectrophotometry.html">spectrophotometrically
calibrated</a> by the Spectro2d pipeline.  Spectral classification,
redshift determination, and emission and absorption line measurements
are carried out by the Spectro1d pipeline. The <a
href="../../algorithms/index.html">algorithms page</a> contains
details about spectroscopic data processing.</p>

<p>The Data Archive Server provides the same spectrum in two
files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spectro2d <a
    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spPlate.html"><code>spPlate*.fits</code></a>: all calibrated spectra from a single plate,
    without any parameters or continuum fits.</li>
  <li>Spectro1d <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html"><code>spSpec*.fits</code></a>:
      multiple fits extensions (images and tables) with the calibrated
      spectrum, a continuum-subtracted spectrum, and all measured parameters
      (redshift, line fits, derived quantities). See <a
      href="./read_spSpec.html">how to read an spSpec file</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to get spectra by coordinates, or to search for spectra by
redshift, object magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve them from the
archive. The quickest way to search spectra is the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/SQS">Spectro Query Server</a> form.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat</strong> for using SDSS-measured redshifts: Only 1%
of the objects have an "unknown" classification. The redshifts of all
but a few tenths of a percent of the remainder are believed to be
correct. <strong>To identify the few objects with unreliable
redshifts, be sure to consider the confidence we have assigned to each
redshift (<code>z_conf</code> in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html">spSpec*.fits primary header</a>,
and the status of the redshift measurement <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zstatus"><code>zStatus</code></a>
and <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zwarning"><code>zWarnin</code></a>,
which may have failed.</strong></p>

<h3> Imaging information associated with each spectrum</h3>

<p> Very often one wishes to obtain all the SDSS photometric (imaging
camera) data associated with each spectrum.  One can obtain this
information most easily for nearly all plates through the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/SQS">SQS</a> interface by
selecting imaging parameters to return with your selected spectra.
There are also available, for those who prefer working with the full
fits files of spectra and imaging catalogs, a special set of files
(<code>spObj-*.fit</code>) containing a bundled version of the
spectroscopic data and all the corresponding imaging data. These files
are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish. To get these files in bulk for the entire survey, see <a
href="./getspectra.html">getting SDSS spectra and corresponding
imaging data</a>.</p>

<p>One caveat is (see below) is that a few plates in DR1 target objects
beyond the <a href="../../coverage/atStripeDef.par">survey limits</a>
for a particular survey stripe.  Their corresponding imaging 
data is not available via a SQS query and thus is most easily 
available through the <code>spObj-*.fit</code> files, which are available
for all plates.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h3>Redshift status</h3>

<p> Only 1% of the objects have an "unknown" classification. The
redshifts of all but a few tenths of a percent of the remainder are
believed to be correct. <strong>To identify the few objects with
unreliable redshifts, be sure to consider the confidence we have
assigned to each redshift (<code>z_conf</code> in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html">spSpec*.fits primary header</a>,
and the status of the redshift measurement <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zstatus"><code>zStatus</code></a>
and <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zwarning"><code>zWarnin</code></a>,
which may have failed.</strong><!-- See <a
href="XXXmissinglinkXXX">spectroscopy documentation on --> <!--
redshift confidence</a> (link to be added). --></p>

<a name="extinct"></a>
<h3>Extinction correction</h3>

<p>Spectra are reddening-corrected and flux-calibrated using reddening
and spectrophotometric standards. This is done under the assumption
that the reddening to the spectrophotometric and reddening stars is
appropriate for every object in the plate (i.e., that the reddening is
uniform on the scale of the plate). The standard stars are behind most
of the Galactic dust causing the Galactic extinction. Therefore,
independently of the precision of our spectrophotometry, this
procedure effectively removes not only telluric, but also the
plate-averaged Galactic extinction. However, although the Galactic
dust is known to vary across a spectroscopic plate (3 degree
field-of-view), no attempt is made to correct for this.</p>

<p>Thus, although there is not much Galactic extinction in the survey
area, applying a further Galactic reddening correction to
extragalactic spectra based on extinction maps will artificially both
increase the flux and make the spectrum bluer, introducing systematic
errors.  Users should <strong>not</strong> apply any reddening
correction to extragalactic spectra. Conversely, nearby stars have
incorrectly been dereddened by this procedure.</p>

<h3>Night sky emission lines</h3>

<p>Beware of night sky emission lines in spectra at 5577&Aring;, 6300&Aring;, and
6363&Aring; which may occasionally be very strong.</p>

<h3>Unmapped fibers</h3>

<p>In a few cases, the fiber mapping failed which identifies which fiber has
been plugged into which hole. When this happens for two or more objects on
the sample plate, there is the possibility of wrong matches between spectra
and photometric objects. There should be no more than a handful of
these cases; we are working on the compilation of a list.</p>

<h3>Velocity dispersion measurements</h3>

<p>The velocity dispersion measurements distributed with SDSS spectra use
template spectra convolved to a maximum sigma of 420 km/s. Therefore,
velocity dispersion sigma &gt; 420 km/s are not reliable and must not be
used. There is a <a href="./test_vdisp_1d_20.ps">postscript file showing the
quality of velocity dispersion error estimates</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We recommend the user to not use SDSS velocity dispersion measurements
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectra with S/N &lt; 10</li>
  <li>velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70 km s<sup>-1</sup>
    given the typical S/N and the instrumental resolution of the SDSS
  spectra</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that the velocity dispersion measurements are not corrected to a
standard relative circular aperture.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../algorithms/veldisp.html">velocity dispersion
algorithm</a> for details.</p>

<h3>"Bonus" plates beyond the survey limits</h3>

<p>A few plates in DR1 target objects beyond the <a
href=../../coverage/atStripeDef.par>survey limits</a> for a particular
survey stripe, stripe 10 (see <a
href="../../coverage/index.html">survey coverage page</a>).  These
plate/MJD combinations are:</p>

<p>Their corresponding imaging data is not available via a regular SQS query 
(which only contains imaging information on <code>PRIMARY</code> objects within
the survey limits) and thus is most easily available through 
the <code>spObj-*.fit</code> files, which are available
for all plates.  These files are available via
the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you wish.
They are also available for bulk <a href="../../data/rsync.html">rsync</a> or
<a href="http://wget.sunsite.dk">wget</a> download 
via <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1/data/">DAS through 
http </a> (in <code>spectro/ss_SPRERUN/PLATE/spObj-*</code>).</p>

<h3>Radial velocity accuracy of stellar redshifts in DR1</h3>

<p>Spectra for approximately 17,600 Galactic stars of all common spectral
types are available with DR1.  Radial velocities (RVs) are stored as
redshifts (multiply by the speed of light to get the RV in km/s) and 
were measured by cross-correlation to a set of stellar
templates.  Also tablulated are measures of individual common spectral
absorption and emission lines, such as Ca II K (3933), the Balmer
series of Hydrogen, and Na (5896), and the offsets of these individual
lines from their vacuum rest wavelengths may be also used to may be
used to estimate a radial velocity (lines are tabulated with a
significance indicator, nSigma, and generally speaking, only lines
above a threshold, such as nSigma &gt; 7, should be considered
reliable). The resolution of the spectrographs
(1800 &lt; R &lt; 2250) suggests that radial velocities should be
measurable with one errors of about 8 km/s for objects
with reasonable S/N in the SDSS.  The current DR1 dispersion solutions
for individual objects have been demonstrated to be good to better
than 5 km/s, including correction for such effects as
flexure of the telescope.  This dispersion error has been determined
by examining multiple observations of the same astrophysical object on
a variety of plates under a variety of observing conditions and
showing that RVs were reproducible to this accuracy.</p>

<p>The DR1 templates used for stellar RVs have shifts due to
zeropointing and (low) signal-to-noise problems with the templates
themselves.  <strong>This introduces systematic errors</strong> in
addition to possible dispersion errors, depending on spectral type.
The templates used for DR2 and beyond will be corrected for these
zeropoint errors.  The error as a function of template are given
below, along with the identity of the actual template star (which may
be examined).  The 'Template Number' for any spectrum may be found
under the keyword 'BESTTEMP' in the PDU header of a SDSS
<code>spSpec-$mjd-$plate-$fiberid.fit file</code>.  A better estimate of the true
RV of a particular object may be found by RV(true) = cz(tabulated)+
RVshift(below).  Estimates for White Dwarf and M,L,T star Radial
velocities are not accurately quoted for DR1.  Interested scientists
are encouraged to compute their own RVs off of the extracted spectra,
keeping in mind that the wavelengths measured of individual lines
measured are on a vacuum system.</p>

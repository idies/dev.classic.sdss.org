  <li> For photometry of resolved sources, one should use Petrosian
      magnitudes, especially at the bright end.  </li>
  <li> For photometry of unresolved sources, one should use PSF
      magnitudes.  </li>
  <li> Colors derived from model magnitudes are almost completely
      insensitive to the bug. Model magnitudes remain the optimal
      quantities to use for the colors of extended objects, especially at
      the faint end.  </li>
  <li> The scale sizes derived from the model fits
      are systematically wrong.  For exponential fits, the effective radii
      are systematically too large by 0.15" in the present code
      (almost independent of r_e itself), while for the de Vaucouleurs
      fits, they are roughly 25% too large (almost independent of r_e
      itself, for r_e &gt; 2 arcsec). These correction factors depend
      on seeing to some level.</li>

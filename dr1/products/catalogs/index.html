<h2>Getting and using object lists</h2>

<p><strong>You need to look at the <a href="./flags.html">object
      flags</a> in the object lists to obtain meaningful
      results.</strong></p>

<p>Calibrated object lists are stored in two file types:
<ul>
  <li><p><a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/tsObj.html"><code>tsObj*.fits</code></a>
      containing the object lists themselves. There is one file
      per <a
      href="../../glossary/index.html#field">field</a>. The files
      are binary fits tables with one row per object.
      <h4>Notes</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>The primary header of <code>tsObj</code> files contains
	    some parameters applying to the entire field, such as the
	    seeing (but also see the PSF parameters in the
	    <code>tsField</code> file below).</li>
	<li>The reported magnitudes are corrected for atmospheric
	    extinction (compare <a
	    href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html#counts2mag">converting
	    counts to magnitudes)</a>, but not for Galactic
	    extinction. The Galactic extinction
	    for each object as derived from <a
	    href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998ApJ...500..525S">Schlegel,
	    Finkbeiner, and Davis (1998)</a> dust maps is reported as
	    <code>reddening</code>. The <a
	    href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithms</a>
	    use magnitudes corrected for both kinds of extinction.</li>
      </ul>
      
      </p>
      
      <p><a href="./read_tsObj.html">How to read tsObj files</a>
      includes an <a href="./read_tsObj.sm">illustrative SM
      script to filter tsObj files</a> and
      explanations of which flags to check.</p></li>
  <li><a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/tsField.html"><code>tsField*.fits</code></a>
      files, with one row of
      parameters relevant to the entire field. This includes the
      average PSF profile, e.g.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/fpAtlas.html"><code>fpAtlas*.fits</code></a>
      files contain "postage-stamp"
      images, the set of pixels determined to belong to each object.
      See <a href="../images/read_atlas.html">how to read an atlas
      image</a>.  </p>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains
      various query forms to search the object lists by coordinates,
      magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve data from the archive.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<h3>Primary caveats for DR1 beta</h3>

<p>The following points apply to the current DR1 beta, produced with
version 5_3 of the photometric pipeline. The next data release will
contain data which have been reduced with version 5_4, which fixes
the bug in 5_3 which leads to these caveats. See <a
href="../../start/aboutdr1.html">About DR1</a>.</p>

<h3>Caveats: subtleties and minor bugs in DR1</h3>

<a name="cav_skybright"></a>
<h4>Sky brightness values are extinction-corrected</h4>

<p>The various measures of sky brightness reported in the
<code>tsField</code> files are corrected for atmospheric extinction in
the same way as calibrated object magnitudes in <code>tsObj</code>
files. To do a correct <a
href="../../algorithms/fluxcal.html#counts2mag">conversion from
magnitudes to counts and vice versa</a>, you need to treat object and
sky magniutdes in the same way.</p>

<a name="cav_objcounts"></a>
<h4>Object counts</h4>

<p>The <code>nobjects</code> etc. entries in <code>tsField</code>
files are currently meaningless. </p>

<a name="cav_astrom_not_r"></a>
<h4>Astrometry</h4>

<p>A bug was found in the reported right ascension and declination
(and all other celestial coordinates, such as l and b,
of course) for those rare sources
that are not detected in the <var>r</var> band.  For example, this bug affects extremely
red objects (brown dwarfs and high-redshift quasars) that are detected only
in the <var>z</var>-band.  The <var>r</var>-band
astrometric solution was applied to the
centroid position in the band in which the object in question was detected. 
As there is typically a few arcsecond offset between the bands,
this results in a few arcsecond error in the position.  The error can be corrected by 
examining the fields <code>offsetRA</code> and
<code>offsetDec</code>.  First, note which band is flagged
<code>CANONICAL_BAND</code> (if this band is the <var>r</var> band,
which is the case the majority of the time, there is no error).</p>

<p>To obtain the correct position for these objects,  
  determine <code>offsetRA/cos(dec)</code> and <code>offsetDec</code>
for this band, and <strong>subtract</strong> these quantities from the
nominal ra and dec.</p>

<a name="cav_redobj"></a>
<h4>Very red objects</h4>

<p>The <var>u</var> magnitudes of very red stars, with spectral types
later than about M0 (<var>u-i</var> &gt; 4), are affected by
camera-column and imaging-run dependent systematic variations of order
0.1 mag, as determined, e.g., from changes in the stellar locus of
these very red stars in color-color diagrams.  The cause of these
<var>u</var>-band systematics is not fully understood at present, but
may be due to a <var>u</var>-band red leak problem which appears to be
larger than original design specifications (due to the effects of the
dewar vacuum shifting the wavelengths of the interference coatings
used to reject red leak for the <var>u</var> filters).  This issue of
<var>u</var>-band systematics for very red stars is being actively
investigated, and we will post our findings at this web site once we
have a fuller understanding of the problem.</p>

<a name="cav_posang"></a>
<h4>Position angles</h4>

<p>The position angle fields in the DR1 dataset (those
processed through photo v5_3 and target v4_5 or lower),
have position angles modulo 360 degrees rather than the
proper standard of modulo 180 degrees (or in the range
[-90,90] degrees).  Please convert the position angles
to mod 180 or to [-90,90] yourself as needed.
This affect the fields: <code>iso_phi, phi_exp, phi_deV</code>
(isophotal position angle, exponential disk fit position angle,
deVauc. fit position angle, all in each of 5 bands) in the
calibrated imaging outputs (<code>tsObj</code> files).  </p>

<a name="cav_skysub"></a>
<h4>Sky determination</h4>

<p>There are known problems in the determination of the
background sky at the level of a few hundredths of a DN.  This seems
tiny, but gives noticeable non-uniformities in the Petrosian
photometry in the u band of large (&gt;10'') galaxies.  We think we
have found a fix, but as of this writing, it is not yet tested.  </p>

<a name="cav_brightgal"></a>
<h4>Deblending of bright galaxies</h4>

<p>The SDSS image deblender works completely automatically, and needs
to work both for the case of a saturated star superposed on the disk
of a face-on spiral galaxy, a small cluster of faint stars, and an
asteroid moving next to a galaxy.  It is known to occasionally
incorrectly deblend galaxies brighter than <var>r=16th</var>
magnitude, giving unphysical deblends in a few percent of the galaxies
in the UZC (<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1999PASP..111..438F">Falco
et al, 1999, PASP, 111, 438</a>).  At the brightest magnitudes, this
fraction probably increases substantially.  Further improvements to
the software, to be included in DR2, are known to reduce this error
rate substantially.  Similarly, there are quite a few false negatives:
typically poorly deblended saturated stars that manifest themselves as
bright galaxies.  Again, this should be much improved in DR2, but in
the meantime, visual inspection will be needed for any astronomer
wishing to put together a complete catalog of bright galaxies, or to
obtain photometry for galaxies brighter than <var>r=16</var>, from the
SDSS outputs.</p>

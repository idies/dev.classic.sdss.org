<h1>Data products: General - How good are the proper motions?</H1>

<p>  The proper motions are calculated during target selection.  Target selection
 provides proper motions by matching each SDSS object against USNOA2.0.  By
 the rules of target selection, each SDSS object must be processed
 independently of other SDSS objects, which forces us to a very simple
 matching algorithm.  The closest object within 30 arcsec is taken as the match,
 and proper motions are calculated using that match. Compare the
description of the <a
href="./astrometry.html">astrometric quality</a> and
the <a href="../../algorithms/astrometry.html">astrometry
algorithm</a></p>

<p> The accuracy of the matching (that is, how many SDSS objects were matched to
 the correct USNOA2.0 object) has been calculated by comparison with
 a more sophisticated matching algorithm.  The following table summarizes the
 results for a single scan (scan 752):</p>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
 The columns in the table are:<br>
<TABLE><border=1>
<TR><TD>   inner </TD><TD>        - minimum matching radius (arcsec) </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>   outer     </TD><TD>    - maximum matching radius (arcsec) </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>   nStars   </TD><TD>     - Percentage of all stars matched by target selection over
                  this range of radii. </TD></TR>
<TR><TD>   nGood    </TD><TD>     - Percentage of stars in this matching annulus which were
                   correctly matched against USNOA2.0. </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
 Thus, 99.9% of all objects which matched within 1 arcsec were correctly
 matched.  The number drops only slightly to 97.1% for objects
 matched between 1 and 2 arcsec.  Thus, out to proper motions of
 4-5 arcsec/century (depending on the epoch of the POSS plates), representing
 96% of the stars, the contamination of false detections is only 2-3% for those
 objects with measurable proper motions (greater than about 1.5 arcsec/century).
 The contamination increases to about 35% for the fastest moving 1% of the
 objects.</p>
<p> The accuracy of the SDSS positions are better than 100 mas, those of USNOA2.0
 about 150 mas, and the difference in epoch about 50 years.  Thus, a proper
 motion of 1.44 arcsec/century is a 4 sigma detection.</p>

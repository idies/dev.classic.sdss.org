<p>The <var>u</var> magnitudes of very red stars, with
spectral types later than about M0 (<var>u-i</var> &gt; 4), are
affected by camera-column and imaging-run dependent systematic
variations of order 0.1 mag, as determined, e.g., from changes in the
stellar locus of these very red stars in color-color diagrams.  The
cause of these <var>u</var>-band systematics is not fully understood
at present, but may be due to a <var>u</var>-band red leak problem
which appears to be larger than original design specifications (due to
the effects of the dewar vacuum shifting the wavelengths of the
interference coatings used to reject red leak for the <var>u</var>
filters).  This issue of <var>u</var>-band systematics for very red
stars is being actively investigated, and we will post our findings at
this web site once we have a fuller understanding of the problem.</p>

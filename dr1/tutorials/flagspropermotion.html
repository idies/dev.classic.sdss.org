<h1>Tutorial: Getting Flags and Proper Motion for a List of 
Targets</h1>

<p>The following procedure outlines how to use the DAS Imaging Query Server 
(IQS) to obtain flags and proper motion for a list of targets.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Access the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/IQS">Imaging Query Server interface</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In the Imaging parameters window, select the list of parameters you want. 
  They are listed by alphabetical order. The list and some explanations are 
  given in <a href="../dm/flatFiles/tsObj.html"> the tsObj file description
  </a>. Flags are described 
  in <a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">the photometric flags page</a>. You can select 
  several contiguous items by using the usual shift-click.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Select <a href="../glossary/index.html#target"><code>Target</code></a> imaging to get the parameters used for the spectroscopy 
  (positions, selection,...). Select <a href="../glossary/index.html#best"><code>Best</code></a> to get the parameters corresponding to the most recent observations and runs of the photometric pipeline. You can also select both.<br>&nbsp;
</li>
  <li>Select for which filters you would like to download the 
  images, catalogues, etc.&nbsp; If you are just looking for catalog information, and not actual images, <a href="../glossary/index.html#tsobj">tsObj</a> files, etc.,  you can leave these unchecked.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In the &quot;Position Constraints&quot; panel you can search a rectangular area, a 
  circular area (Cone Search), or for the closest object only (Proximity Search).&nbsp; For the Proximity Search, your upload file (or the window containing the coordinates) must have as the first line &quot;ra,dec,sep&quot;, and the separation must be specified in arcseconds (max 10).&nbsp; If you specify both an upload file and give coordinates in the window, the upload file will be used.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In the &quot;Imaging Constraints&quot; you can place a few constraints based on 
  magnitudes, colors or flags.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Submit your query</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
Once you get the page with the results presented in a table, you can proceed to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>download the results as an ASCII comma-separated table</li>
  <li>download the results as a FITS table</li>
  <li>proceed to the data archive server to get images, catalogues, and more 
  files (see below)</li>
  <li>proceed to the FOOT web form to get small JPEG images (limited to a maximum of 10 at a time)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
If you choose to get more information on your targets, proceed to the
<a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR1-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS web form </a>and:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the products and files you want to download (<i>Step 1 on the form</i>)</li>
  <li>Skip steps 2 and 3 on the form (these have already been taken care of by 
  using your first query's results)</li>
  <li>Select your format (<i>Step 4 on the form</i>)</li>
  <li>Submit your query.</li>
</ol>

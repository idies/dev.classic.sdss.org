<h2>About spectroscopic samples</h2>

<p>The spectroscopic survey is predominantly a survey for</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bright galaxies, the "main" sample, with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band
    magnitude &lt; 17.77 (to get an idea of their distribution, see
      this <a href="./pieplot.ps">pie plot showing the redshift
      distribution of 78275 DR1 galaxies with
      -15&deg; &lt; DEC &lt; 20&deg;</a>).</li>
  <li>Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with Petrosian <var>r</var>-band magnitude
    down to 19.5 (see this <a href="./zdist.ps">redshift distribution
      of DR2 "main" galaxies and LRGs</a>), and</li>
  <li>Quasars, targetting  quasar candidates as faint as <var>i &lt;
      20.2</var> (see this <a href="./qsozdist.ps">DR2 quasar
      redshift distribution</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a large number of spectra of stars. Brown dwarfs, ROSAT and
FIRST counterparts are targetted as well. Refer to the <a
href="../general/target_quality.html">target selection quality</a> or <a
href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection algorithm</a> for
details about the spectroscopic survey targets.</p>

<h2>Getting and using spectra</h2>

<p>The spectra distributed by the SDSS have been sky subtracted,
corrected for telluric absorption <a
href="../../algorithms/spectrophotometry.html">spectrophotometrically
calibrated</a> by the Spectro2d pipeline.  Spectral classification,
redshift determination, and emission and absorption line measurements
are carried out by the Spectro1d pipeline. The <a
href="../../algorithms/index.html">algorithms page</a> contains
details about spectroscopic data processing.</p>

<p>The Data Archive Server provides the same spectrum in two
files:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spectro2d <code>spPlate*.fits</code>:
      all calibrated spectra and supporting data (signal-to-noise,
      resolution, quality flags and similar) from a single plate,
      without any parameters or continuum fits. See the <a
    href="../../dm/flatFiles/spPlate.html"><code>spPlate*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents.</li>
  <li>Spectro1d <code>spSpec*.fits</code>:
      multiple fits extensions (images and tables) with the calibrated
      spectrum, a continuum-subtracted spectrum, and all measured parameters
      (redshift, line fits, line indices, per-pixel resolution). See
      the <a
      href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html"><code>spSpec*.fits</code>
      data model</a> for details of the file contents, and <a
      href="./read_spSpec.html">how to read an spSpec file</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="../../access/">data access</a> page contains various
query forms to get spectra by coordinates, or to search for spectra by
redshift, object magnitude, color etc., and to retrieve them from the
archive. In particular, the <a
href="../../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> provides
a fast search capability for object lists and spectroscopic parameters
as well as pointers to the files in the <a
href="../../access/index.html#DAS">Data Archive Server</a>. The <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr3/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro
Query Server</a> query form is dedicated to the search of the
spectroscopic database.</p>

<p>Please note the <a href="#caveats">caveats</a> below, which are
essential to obtain meaningful scientific results from analysing SDSS
spectra, in particular the <a href="#zstatus">redshift status caveat</a>.</p>


<h3> Imaging information associated with each spectrum</h3>

<p> Very often one wishes to obtain all the SDSS photometric (imaging
camera) data associated with each spectrum.  One can obtain this
information most easily for nearly all plates through the <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr3/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">SQS</a>
interface by selecting imaging parameters to return with your selected
spectra.</p>

<p>For those who prefer working with the full fits files of spectra
and imaging catalogs, we will make available a special set of files
(<code>spObj-*.fit</code>) containing a bundled version of the
spectroscopic data and all the corresponding imaging data (as for DR1)
in the near future</p>

<p>These files are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR3-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish. To get these files in bulk for the entire survey, see <a
href="./getspectra.html">getting SDSS spectra and corresponding
imaging data</a>.</p>

<h3>Further details</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Error and mask arrays are available (see the <a

      The sky spectrum
    subtracted from each object spectrum is not currently available.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Spectroscopic observations are undertaken in non-photometric conditions
      when the imaging camera is not in use. At least three
      fifteen-minute exposures are taken until the cumulative mean S/N
      per pixel exceeds 4 for a fiducial fiber magnitude of
      <var>g</var> = 20.2 and <var>i </var>= 19.9.

<a name="caveats"></a>
<h2>Caveats</h2>

<a name="EWhalpha"></a>
<h3>Zero equivalent width of emission lines, especially H alpha</h3>

<p>There is a bug in the line-measurement code that has been in use
since DR3 which gives some emission lines an equivalent width of zero,
even though there is a significant line detection. The aim of the
change introducing the bug had been to determine the equivalent width
by integrating the spectrum, instead of using the parameters of a
fitted Gaussian. The Gauss-fit equivalent width can be recovered from the
fit parameters using the usual expression <code>EW = 2.5066 * sigma *
height / continuum</code>.</p>

<a name="zstatus"></a>
<h3>Redshift status</h3>

<p> Only 1% of the objects have an "unknown" classification, usually
because of low signal-to-noise ratio or completely featureless
spectra. The redshifts of all but a few tenths of a percent of the
remainder are believed to be correct. <strong>To identify the few
objects with unreliable redshifts, be sure to consider the confidence
we have assigned to each redshift (<code>z_conf</code> in the <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html">spSpec*.fits primary header</a>,
and the status <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zstatus"><code>zStatus</code></a>
and <a
href="../../dm/flatFiles/spSpec.html#zwarning"><code>zWarnin</code></a>
of the redshift measurement, which may have failed.</strong>). A
useful cut on the redshift confidence is <code>z_conf &gt; 0.35</code>
(or <code>zConf &gt; 0.35</code> in the SQL database).
<!-- See <a href="XXXmissinglinkXXX">spectroscopy documentation on -->
<!-- redshift confidence</a> (link to be added). --></p>

<a name="extinct"></a>
<h3>Galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="./galextinction.html"-->

<h3>Night sky emission lines</h3>

<p>The night sky emission lines at 5577&Aring, (when there is auroral
activity) at 6300&Aring;, 6363&Aring;, and in the OH forest in the red
can be very strong, and leave significant residuals in the spectra
whose amplitude is occasionally underestimated by the noise model.  Be
cautious about interpreting the reality of weak features close to
these lines.</p>

<a name="badplates"></a>
<h3>Plates with not-quite-perfect spectrophotometry</h3>

<p>A small number of plates, given in the <a href="badplates.txt">list
of not-quite-perfect plates</a>, suffered from a variety of minor
problems.  The CCD frames for several plates suffered from a transient
electronic problem in the red camera in Spectrograph 2, causing the
columns of the CCD to be misaligned on readout.  This was fixed in
software, and we believe the data to be reliable.  Another set of
plates labeled &quot;Spectrograph Collimation Problem&quot; suffered
from having the spectrograph collimator improperly focused.  This
problem caused a mismatch between the flatfields and the science
exposure instrumental profile shapes on the CCD in both the spatial
and wavelength directions, causing the optimal extraction process to
reject an excessive number of pixels.  This problem was fixed in
software, and comparing overlapping objects from adjacent plates
confirms that the redshifts from these problematic plates are
unbiased.  However, the spectra themselves should not be used for
precision work or spectrophotometry.  Other plates have individual
problems as noted. E.g., during the exposure of one plate, light from
an LED somewhere on the telescope found its way to the spectrographs,
resulting in an artificial excess of light centered roughly at
6500&Aring;; the spectrophotometry of this plate is quite poor.</p>

<a name="specphotomismatch"></a>
<h3>Mismatches between spectra and photometric data</h3>

<p>In a few cases, the fiber mapping failed which identifies which
fiber has been plugged into which hole. When this happens for two or
more objects on the sample plate, there is the possibility of wrong
matches between spectra and photometric objects. There are 62 objects
for which the mapping between object and spectrum cannot be
established (&quot;unmapped fibers&quot;); their ra/dec is listed as
-9999 in the spectroscopic data set.</p>

<p>Errors in the deblending algorithm in the <code>target</code> reductions
caused spectroscopy to be carried out occasionally on non-existent
objects (e.g., diffraction spikes of bright stars or satellite
trails).  Many of these objects no longer exist in the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions with its improvements to the deblender.  In other
cases, the photometric pipeline timed out during the <code>best</code>
imaging reductions in fields for which <code>target</code> imaging proceeded
without problem, so that the <code>best</code> photometry is missing for
bona-fide objects. This predominantly happens in fields close to a few
very bright stars.  We expect to recover objects from these ``timeout
holes'' in future data releases.</p>

<p>A total of 663 spectroscopic objects therefore do not have a
counterpart in the <code>best</code> catalogs, 0.2% of the total.  Of
these, 80 (including the 62 unmapped fibers) can only be retrieved
from the table <code>specObjAll</code> in the database.  The remaining
583 objects are contained in the default spectroscopic table
<code>specObj</code>, but will not be found by queries requesting both
photometric and spectroscopic information.</p>

<a name="galveldisp"></a>
<h3>Galaxy velocity dispersion measurements</h3>

<p>The velocity dispersion measurements distributed with SDSS spectra use
template spectra convolved to a maximum sigma of 420 km/s. Therefore,
velocity dispersion sigma &gt; 420 km/s are not reliable and must not be
used. There is a <a href="./test_vdisp_1d_20.ps">postscript file showing the
quality of velocity dispersion error estimates</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We recommend the user to not use SDSS velocity dispersion measurements
for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>spectra with median per-pixel S/N &lt; 10</li>
  <li>velocity dispersion estimates smaller than about 70 km s<sup>-1</sup>
    given the typical S/N and the instrumental resolution of the SDSS
  spectra</li>
</ul>

<p>Also note that the velocity dispersion measurements are not corrected to a
standard relative circular aperture.</p>

<p>See the <a href="../../algorithms/veldisp.html">velocity dispersion
algorithm</a> for details.</p>

<a name="bonusplates"></a>
<h3>"Bonus" plates beyond the survey limits</h3>

<p>A few plates target objects beyond the <a
href=../../coverage/atStripeDef.par>survey limits</a> for a particular
survey stripe, stripe 10 (see <a
href="../../coverage/index.html">survey coverage page</a>).  These
plate/MJD combinations are:</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Plate</th><th>MJD</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>343</td><td>51692 (straddles stripe limits)</td></td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>344</td><td>51693</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <td>345</td><td>51690</td>

</table>

<p>Their corresponding <code>target</code>imaging data does not
contain any <code>PRIMARY</code> objects. Objects from this region are
therefore not available via a normal search of the <code>target</code>
object lists.  To find the target data, select on <code>status &
0x402</code> (both <code>GOOD</code> and <code>OK_SCANLINE</code>)
instead of selecting on the <code>PRIMARY</code> flag being set in
<code>status</code>. The information is also contained in the
<code>spObj-*.fit</code> files, which are available for all plates.
These files are available via the <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR3-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS</a> by requesting the
data product <code>tsObjFromMap (or spObj)</code> for the plates you
wish.  They are also available for bulk <a
href="../../data/rsync.html">rsync</a> or <a
href="http://wget.sunsite.dk">wget</a> download via <a
href="http://das.sdss.org/DR3/data/">DAS through http </a> (in
<code>spectro/ss_SPRERUN/PLATE/spObj-*</code>).</p>

<p>These objects have been declared <code>primary</code> in the
<code>best</code> data set.  The CAS correctly records the positional
matches between these spectra and their counterparts in
<code>best</code>. However, since the corresponding targets are not
primary, the spectra are not included in the <code>specObj</code> and
<code>specPhoto</code> views in the CAS, but must be searched
explicitly in <code>specObjAll</code> and
<code>photoObjAll</code>.</p>

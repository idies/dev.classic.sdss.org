<h1>Newer edition of SDSS Quasar Catalog available</h1>

<p>As of March 2005, the third edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog,
based on DR3 data and containing 46,420 objects, is available. This
new catalog supersedes all previous editions, which are retained at
their old URLs for reference. Go to <a href="./qsocat_DR3.html">the
Third edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog</a>.

<h1>Second edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog</h1>

<p>The DR1 quasar catalog is described in Schneider et al. 2003, AJ
accepted (scheduled to appear in the December 2003 issue and available
at <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0308443">astro-ph/0308443</a>). The
catalog contains 16,713 objects from DR1 that have <var>i</var>-band
absolute magnitudes brighter than -22 and contain at least one broad
emission line. The catalog was created by inspecting all spectra that
were either targeted as quasar candidates, or classified as a quasar
by the <a href="../../algorithms/redshift_type.html">spectroscopic
pipelines</a>.</p>

<h3>SDSS Quasar Catalog redshifts supersede those in other DR1 data
products</h3>

<p>Because of the re-inspection of the spectra, the DR1 Quasar
Catalog provides the most reliable classifications and redshifts of
SDSS quasars. The classifications in the catalog supersede those
found in other DR1 data products accessible from the <a
href="../../access/">DR1 data access page</a>, as well as from
the EDR quasar catalog (see below). The improved classifications will
be fed back into other data products for future data
releases.</p>

<h3>The DR1 Quasar Catalog is not a statistical sample</h3>

<p>There are two reasons:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It includes objects from all categories of <a
      href="../../algorithms/target.html">target selection</a> in SDSS, not just those
      selected as quasar candidates.</li>
  <li><p>While the catalog does contain target selection flags
      which make it easy to remove non-quasar candidates, the
      quasars in the catalog were all selected during the
      commissioning period. This period saw 12 different
      versions of the target selection software; none of the
      quasars in the catalog were selected using the <a
      href="../../algorithms/target.html#qso">final quasar target selection algorithm</a> described in
      <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n6/201557/201557.html">Richards et al. 2002</a>, which
      was the 13th.</p>
      <p>The catalog contains both the
      <code>TARGET</code> selection flags used to select spectroscopic
      targets, and the <code>BEST</code> selection flags obtained by
      applying the final target selection version (sometimes to better
      photometric data obtained later during the survey - see <a
      href="">target and best coverage</a>). However, in addition to
      <em>dropping</em>
      catalog entries which were not selected by the final version,
      one has to account for missing quasar candidates, i.e., those identified by
      the final target selection algorithm but without
      spectroscopic observations.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>These caveats aside, the selection of UV excess quasars has
remained reasonably uniform. These constitute 80% of the objects in
the DR1 Catalog. Changes to the target selection algorithm were
primarily aimed at improving the effectiveness of the identification
of <var>z</var>&gt; 2.5 quasars.</p>

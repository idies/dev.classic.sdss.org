<h1>Algorithms: Astrometry</h1>

<p>A detailed description of the astrometric calibration is given in
<a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v125n3/202156/202156.html">Pier et al. (2003)</a>
(AJ, or <a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0211375">astro-ph/0211375</a>).
Portions of that discussion are summarized here, and
on the <a href="../products/general/astrometry.html">astrometry quality overview
page</a>.</p>

<p>
The <var>r</var> photometric CCDs serve as the astrometric reference CCDs for the SDSS.
That is, the positions for SDSS objects are based on the <var>r</var> centroids and
calibrations.  The <var>r</var> CCDs are calibrated by matching up bright stars detected
by SDSS with existing astrometric reference catalogs.  One of two reduction
strategies is employed, depending on the coverage of the astrometric catalogs:

<ol>
<li> Whenever possible, stars detected on the <var>r</var> CCDs are matched
     directly with stars in the 
     <a href="http://ad.usno.navy.mil/ucac/">United States Naval Observatory CCD
     Astrograph Catalog</a>
     (UCAC, <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000AJ....120.2131Z">Zacharias et al. 2000</a>), an (eventually)
     all-sky astrometric catalog with a precision of 70 mas at its catalog
     limit of <var>r</var>= 16, and systematic errors of less than 30 mas.
     There are approximately 2 - 3 magnituds of overlay between UCAC and
     unsaturated stars on the <var>r</var> CCDs.  The astrometric CCDs
     are not used.  For DR2/DR3, stripes 9-13, 76, 82, and 86 used UCAC.
<li> If a scan is not covered by the current version of UCAC, then it is
     reduced against Tycho-2
     (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26A...355L..27H">Hog et al. 2000</a>), an all-sky astrometric catalog
     with a median precision of 70 mas at its catalog limit of
     V<sub>T</sub> = 11.5, and
     systematic errors of less than 1 mas.  All Tycho-2 stars are saturated
     on the <var>r</var> CCDs; however there are about 3.5 magnitudes of overlap between
     bright unsaturated stars on the astrometric CCDs and the faint end of
     Tycho-2 ( 8 &lt; <var>r</var> &lt; 11.5), and about 3 magnitudes of overlap between bright
     unsaturated stars on the <var>r</var> CCDs and faint stars on the astrometric CCDs
     (14 &lt; <var>r</var> &lt; 17).  The overlap stars in common to
    the astrometric and <var>r</var> CCDs
     are used to map detections of Tycho-2 stars on the astrometric CCDs onto
     the <var>r</var> CCDs.  For DR2/DR3, stripes 30-43 used Tycho-2.
</ol>

The <var>r</var> CCDs are therefore calibrated directly against the
primary astrometric reference catalog.  FRAMES uses the astrometric
calibrations to match up detections of the same object observed in the
other four filters.  The accuracy of the relative astrometry between
filters can thus significantly impact FRAMES, in particular the
deblending of overlapping objects, photometry based on the same
aperture in different filters, and detection of moving objects.  To
minimize the errors in the relative astrometry between filters, the
<var>u</var>, <var>g</var>, <var>i</var>, and <var>z</var> CCDs are
calibrated against the <var>r</var> CCDs.  <p> Each drift scan is
processed separately.  All six camera columns are processed in a
single reduction.  In brief, stars detected on the <var>r</var> CCDs
if calibrating against UCAC, or stars detected on the astrometric CCDs
transformed to <var>r</var> coordinates if calibrating against
Tycho-2, are matched to catalog stars.  Transformations from
<var>r</var> pixel coordinates to catalog mean place (CMP) celestial
coordinates are derived using a running-means least-squares fit to a
focal plane model, using all six <var>r</var> CCDs together to solve
for both the telescope tracking and the <var>r</var> CCDs' focal plane
offsets, rotations, and scales, combined with smoothing spline fits to
the intermediate residuals.  These transformations, comprising the
calibrations for the <var>r</var> CCDs, are then applied to the stars
detected on the <var>r</var> CCDs, converting them to CMP coordinates
and creating a catalog of secondary astrometric standards.  Stars
detected on the <var>u</var>, <var>g</var>, <var>i</var>, and
<var>z</var> CCDs are then matched to this secondary catalog, and a
similar fitting procedure (each CCD is fitted separately) is used to
derive transformations from the pixel coordinates for the other
photometric CCDs to CMP celestial coordinates, comprising the
calibrations for the <var>u</var>, <var>g</var>, <var>i</var>, and
<var>z</var> CCDs.  <p> Notes: At the edges of pixels, the quantities
<em>objc_rowc</em> and <em>objc_colc</em> take integer values.

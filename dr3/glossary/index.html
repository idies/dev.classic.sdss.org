<a name="adaptive_moment"></a>

<h3>adaptive moments</h3>

A method of measuring object shapes. These moments are close to
optimal for measuring the shapes of faint galaxies, and have been used
for weak lensing studies. See the <a
href="../algorithms/adaptive.html">Adaptive Moments</a> section of the
<a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="APO"></a>

<h3>APO</h3>

Apache Point Observatory, located in Sunspot, New Mexico. This is the
location of the 2.5m SDSS telescope as well as the <a

non-SDSS telescopes. See <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/">APO
homepage</a>.

<a name="ARC"></a>

<h3>ARC</h3>
Astrophysical Research Consortium.  Body that owns and operates <a href="#apo">APO</a>.

<a name="asinh"></a>

<h3>asinh magnitude</h3> 
Magnitudes within the SDSS are expressed as inverse 
hyperbolic sine (or ``asinh'') magnitudes, sometimes referred to informally as <em>luptitudes</em> .
The transformation from linear flux measurements to asinh magnitudes
is designed to be virtually identical to the standard astronomical
magnitude at high signal-to-noise ratio, but to switch over to linear behavior at low S/N and even at negative values of flux,
where the logarithm in the <a href="#mag_pogson">Pogson magnitude</a> fails.  Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages, or the actual <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v118n3/990094/990094.html" target="new">Lupton et al. 1999 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="astrans"></a>

<h3>asTrans file</h3>

<a name="Astrda"></a>

<h3>AstroDA</h3>
The data acquisition and analysis system used to collect data from the survey telescope cameras.

<a name="Astrom"></a>

<h3>Astrom</h3>
The data processing pipeline that maps CCD pixel coordinates to celestial coordinates. The detailed workings of this pipeline are described in the <a href="../algorithms/astrometry.html">Astrometry</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>, or the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v125n3/202156/202156.html" target="new">Pier et al. 2003 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="astrom_chip"></a>

<h3>astrometric chip</h3>The SDSS <a href="#camera">camera</a>
contains 24 2048x400 pixel CCDs (in addition to the 30 2048x2048
photometric CCDs) which are used for astrometry and focus
monitoring. Because they are smaller chips, the effective exposure
time is only 11 seconds, allowing the survey to observe brighter stars
without saturation. These bright star positions are necessary to match
to objects present in astrometric catalogs used by the <a
href="#Astrom">Astrom pipeline</a>. For more details on these chips,
please see the appropriate section of the <a
href="../instruments/imager/index.html">camera pages</a> or the AJ
imaging camera paper (<a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v116n6/980260/980260.html"

<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
<h3><u>B</u></h3>

<a name="best"></a>

<h3>Best</h3>

We maintain multiple versions of the SDSS imaging data set. The
<b>Best</b> version contains the images and photometric catalogs with
the highest quality data at the time of the data release. The <a
href="#target">target</a> version contains those data at the time the
target selection algorithm was run for that part of the sky.  The DR1
"best" data set contains better data for some parts of the sky than
the DR1 "target" data set (including most of the EDR data set).
<!-- If newer data of -->
<!-- better quality becomes available for a piece of sky (specifically, if -->
<!-- a <a href="#chunk">chunk</a> is newly <a -->
<!-- href="#resolve">resolved</a>), the old data is removed from this -->
<!-- database and replaced. Therefore, this database is <em>not</em> -->
<!-- static. In general, we plan to update this database every few -->
<!-- months. For the DR1-beta, the contents of this database are -->
<!-- fixed, -->
<!-- however. -->

<a name="binned_frame"></a>

<h3>binned frame</h3>
Each file is a FITS image for one filter, 512 x 372 pixels, with WCS information. These are the <a href="#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a> with detected objects removed and binned 4 pixels by 4 pixels. All pixels that are in <a href="#atlas_image">atlas images</a> are replaced by the background level before binning, with suitable noise added. All of the header parameters from the original image are inherited as well. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

<a name="blackbook"></a>

<h3>Black Book</h3>
Similar to the <em>Project Book</em>, this document provides a
description of the original science goals of the survey, as well as
the hardware and software designs, and was the 1996 proposal to
NASA. Please keep in mind that it is <em>not</em> updated, so
information within it may no longer be current. Nevertheless, it
provides an excellent overview of the survey. The <a
href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/PBOOK/welcome.htm">Black Book</a>
is available online.

<a name="boresight"></a>

<h3>boresight</h3>
The telescope control computer keeps track
of a specific point in the telescope focal plane that is called the <b>boresight</b>. The boresight is not fixed in the array but is at one of two
places for the two <a href="#strip">strips</a> that compose a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. It is the boresight that will track <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circles</a>. Technically, the boresight tracks a path that is a great circle in J2000 coordinates as viewed from the solar system barycenter.

<a name="C"></a>
<p><br><a href="#top"><img src="../shared_images/backtotop.gif" border=0></a>
<h3><u>C</u></h3>

<a name="calibration"></a>

<h3>calibration</h3>
The process by which the photometric and spectroscopic observations are calibrated. The goal of calibration is to take the digital camera readouts and convert them to measured quantities, like fluxes. The details of these procedures can be found on the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="camcol"></a>

<h3>camcol</h3>
A Camcol is the output of one camera column as part of a <a href="#run">Run</a>. Therefore, 1 Camcol = 1/6 of a Run. It is also a portion of a <a href="#scanline">scanline</a>.

<a name="camera"></a>

<h3>camera</h3>

The instrument used for imaging. It consists of 30 photometric and 24
astrometric CCDs (see <a
href="../instruments/imager/index.html">camera description</a>).  The
camera is a mosaic of 54 CCD detectors in the focal plane, 30 large
devices arranged in 6 columns of 5 each and 24 smaller devices around
the periphery. See this <a href="../shared_images/camera.gif">sketch
of the camera focal plane</a> or this <a
href="../shared_images/camopen.jpg">real life image</a>. The camera is
described in detail in the imaging camera paper (<a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v116n6/980260/980260.html"
target="new">Gunn et al. 1998</a>).


<a name="CAS"></a>

<h3>CAS (Catalog Archive Server)</h3>

The <a href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a>
contains the measured parameters from all objects in the imaging
survey and the spectroscopic survey. It will become available as part
of the next data release.

<a name="central_meridian"></a>

<h3>central meridian</h3>
The meridian which passes through the center of the survey area, 12h 20m , defines the central meridian of a scan. The great
circle perpendicular to it passing through the survey center at <img src="../shared_images/delta.gif">=32.8deg is the <a href="#survey_equator">survey equator</a>. 

<a name="child"></a>

<h3>child</h3>
A product of the <a href="#deblend">deblending</a> process. When two objects are near each other on the sky, their images may appear merged. The deblender tries to split this merged image; the resulting sub-images are called children. The initial merged image is called a <a href="#parent">parent</a>. For more details, see the <a href="../algorithms/deblend.html">Deblending</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="chunk"></a>

<h3>chunk</h3>

A chunk is composed of a set of touching but non-overlapping primary
<a href="#segment">segments</a> (or parts of segments) which fills a
"chunk" of a <a href="#stave">stave</a>, and is therefore bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant <a href="#mu">mu</a>, and
north-south by lines of constant <a href="#eta">eta</a> (if in the
North). Southern chunks have no eta boundary applied.  A chunk may
also have a <a href="#lambda ">lambda</a> cut if it is at the end of
the survey region for that stripe. Chunks do not overlap, so the union
of all existing chunks represents the unique sky coverage for the
survey at any given time. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure explaining the SDSS survey
geometry</a> for details. Note that the bounds on chunks, if using
mu/eta, are a mix of <a href="#survey_coords">survey coordinates</a>
and <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle
coordinates</a>. <b>Note:</b> The term chunk has sometimes been used
to describe an area of sky that has had <a href="#tiling">tiling</a>
run on it. This is properly called a <a href="#tile_region">tiled
region</a>.

<a name="classification"></a>

<h3>classification</h3>
The method by which we assign a type (star or galaxy) to each <a href="#object">object</a>. The details of this procedure are described in the <a href="../algorithms/classify.html">Classification</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="cloud_cam"></a>

cmodel</a>.

<a name="coordinates"></a>
<h3>coordinates</h3>
The SDSS uses three different coordinate systems. Of course, we use
standard astronomical right ascension (RA) and declination (Dec),
J2000. There is also the <em><a href="#survey_coords">survey
coordinate system</a></em>, with coordinates <a href="#lambda">lambda
(<IMG SRC="../shared_images/lambda.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&lambda;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a> and <a href="#eta">eta (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/eta.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&eta;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a>. This is just a rotation of the usual RA, Dec
system. Finally, there is the <em><a href="#great_circle_coords">great
circle coordinate system</a></em>, which is actually a separate
coordinate system for each <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. The
coordinates of this system are <a href="#mu">mu (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/mu.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&mu;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a> and <a href="#nu">nu (<IMG
SRC="../shared_images/nu.gif" BORDER="0" ALT="&nu;"
ALIGN="BASELINE">)</a>.

<a name="corrected_frame"></a>

<h3>corrected frame</h3>
Each corrected frame is a FITS image for one filter, 2048 columns by 1489 rows, with row number increasing in the scan direction. These are the imaging frames with flat-field, bias, cosmic-ray, and pixel-defect corrections applied. A raw image contains 1361 rows, and a corrected frame has the first 128 rows of the following corrected frame appended to it. The pixels subtend 0".396 square on the sky. Header information using the <a href="#wcs">world coordinate system (WCS)</a> allows standard astronomical FITS tools to convert pixel position to right ascension and declination. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

href="../access/index.html">descriptions of the DAS data access
tools</a>.

<a name="data_model"></a>

<h3>data model</h3>
The description of the structure and organization of the data in a database. The data model tells you all the tables names, their contents, and how they are related to, and linked with, one another. The actual implementation of a data model is called the database schema. For the flat files available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>, the data models are available <a href="../dm/flatFiles/FILES.html">here</a>.

<a name="deblend"></a>

<h3>deblend</h3>
Deblending is the process by which overlapping objects in images are separated. The <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a> attempts to determine whether each object actually consists of
more than one object projected on the sky and, if so, to deblend such a <a href="#parent">parent</a> object into its constituent <a href="#child">children</a>, self-consistently across the bands (thus, all children have measurements in all bands). For details on how this works, and what <a href="#flag">flags</a> this procedure may set, see the <a href="../algorithms/deblend.html">Deblending</a> section of the <a href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms pages</a>.

<a name="EDR"></a><a name="edr"></a>

<h3>EDR</h3>

Early Data Release. The first public release of SDSS data occurred in
June of 2001. This current release (DR1) includes the area present in
the EDR, and more. The data has also been reprocessed with improved
software. The EDR is described in the <a
href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n1/201415/201415.html">EDR

Constant latitude curves are great circles

<a name="exp"></a>

<h3>exponential model</h3>
The radial light distribution of a disk galaxy can often be fit by an exponential profile:<br>
<b>I(r) = I<sub>0</sub>exp(-1.68r/r<sub>e</sub>)</b><br>
The number 1.68 is chosen so that the
model radius is a half-light radius. An elliptical version of
this profile is fit to every detected object, yielding the <code>exp</code> parameters. See the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">model magnitude section of the photometry algorithm page</a> for details.

A  pipeline to produce 3-color JPG files of 
zoomed-down SDSS images.  

<a name="fiber"></a>

<h3>fiber</h3>
The SDSS spectrograph uses optical fibers to direct the light from individual objects to the slithead. Each object is assigned a corresponding <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">fiberID</b></font>. The fibers are 3 arcsec in diameter in the source plane. Each fiber is surrounded by a large sheath which prevents any pair of fibers from being placed closer than 55 arcsec on the same <a href="#plate"> plate</a>.

2048x1489 pixels; a field consists of the <a href="#frame">frames</a>
in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky. Fields overlap each
other by 128 rows; <a href="#primary">primaries</a> are decided when
<a href="#chunk">Chunks</a> are <a href="#resolve">resolved</a> (using
objects between rows 64 and1425 as primaries). A field at the edge of
a Chunk may in fact be included in 2 (or more) Chunks. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure explaining SDSS field
geometry</a> for details.

<a name="filter"></a>

<h3>filter</h3>
A piece of material used to allow only specific colors (or wavelengths) of light to pass through. The SDSS uses five filters: <em>u,g,r,i,z</em>. However, defining standards and absolute calibration for these filters has been difficult. Please read the <a href="../instruments/imager/index.html">Camera Page</a> for details. 

<a name="FITS"></a>

<h3>FITS</h3>
The Flexible Image Transport System, a standard method of storing astonomical data. The FITS format has a <a href="http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/">home page</a>.

<a name="flag"></a>

<h3>flag</h3>
A bitmask used in the database to specify various properties of an object. There are many flags in the SDSS catalogs which tell the user extremely important and useful pieces of information, such as whether the object was <a href="#deblend">deblended</a> or saturated, for instance. There are
   status flags set by PSP, and by survey operations, on a
   frame-by-frame basis, describing the quality of the PSF, and the
   quality of the data overall.  Each object is given status flags
   that sort out overlaps.  And the spectra have flags at two levels
   as well: pixel-by-pixel flags, and warning flags accompanying the
   redshifts and classification to indicate trouble.
For more help with flags, see the <a href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">Flags Help Page</a>.

<a name="frame"></a>

<h3>frame</h3>
The data stream from a single CCD in a scanline is cut into a series of frames which measure 2048 x 1489 pixels and overlap 10% with the adjacent frame. The frames in the 5 filters for the same part of the sky are called a <a href="#field">field</a>. 

<a name="frames_pipeline"></a>

<h3>frames pipeline</h3>
In this pipeline, the images are  bias-subtracted and flat-fielded, and bad
     columns, cosmic rays, and bleed trails are interpolated over.
     This yields <a href="#corrected_frame">corrected frames</a>.  Then objects are found by running a
     PSF-matched filter over the image, and matched up between the
     five frames making up a field.  A <a href="#deblend">deblender</a> is run to resolve
     overlaps, and the properties of each object are written to the
     <a name="#fpObjc">fpObjc</a> files.  Atlas images are written to the <a name="#fpAtlas">fpAtlas</a> files.

<a name="fundamental_standard"></a>

<h3>fundamental standard</h3>
The photometry of the primary standard stars
is ultimately tied to the SED of the star BD 17 +4708, which is the
fundamental standard for the SDSS photometric system.  See the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n4/201445/201445.html"> Smith et al. 2002 AJ paper</a> for more details.

<a name="great_circle_coords"></a>

<h3>great circle coordinates</h3>
One of the two main coordinate systems 
utilized by the SDSS. In this system, <a href="#mu">mu</a> and <a href="#nu">nu</a> are spherical coordinates (corresponding to ra and dec) in a system whose equator is along the center of the <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> in question. The stripes of the survey are great circles which all cross at (RA, Dec) = (95, 0). The stripes are defined by their inclination with respect to the equator, and are indexed by integers <em>n</em> such that the inclination of a stripe is -25 + 2.5<em>n</em>. Thus, stripe <em>n</em>=10 corresponds to the Equator. The design is that the area covered by the imaging on a given stripe (the so-called OK_SCANLINE area in the north) is a 2.5 degree wide rectangle centered on nu=0 in Great Circle coordinates.

<a name="maggie"></a>

<h3>maggie</h3>
A <em>maggie</em> is a linear
measure of flux; one maggie has an AB magnitude of 0 (thus a surface
brightness of 20 mag/square arcsec corresponds to 10<sup>-8</sup> maggies
per square arcsec). This unit is used for object <a href="#profile">radial profiles</a>, where we provide the azimuthally averaged object surface brightness in a series of annuli.

<a name="mag_cmodel"></a>
<h3>magnitude, cmodel</h3>

Composite model magnitude. The magnitude obtained from the
best-fitting linear combination of the best-fitting de Vaucouleurs and
exponential model for an object's light profile (cf. <a
href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">magnitude, model</a>). See <a
href="../algorithms/photometry.html#cmodel">cmodel magnitude
description</a> in Photometry section of the Algorithms pages.

<a name="mag_fiber"></a>
<h3>magnitude, fiber</h3>
The flux contained within the aperture of a <a href="#fiber">spectroscopic fiber</a>
(3" in diameter) is calculated in each band and stored in <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">
fiberMag</b></font>. Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_fiber">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages.
<br>

<a name="mag_model"></a>

<h3>magnitude, model</h3>
Just as the <a href="#mag_psf">PSF magnitudes</a> are optimal measures of the fluxes of
stars, the optimal measure of the flux of a galaxy would use a matched galaxy
model.  With this in mind, the code fits two models to the
two-dimensional image of each object in each band:<br>
1. a pure deVaucouleurs profile, and<br>
2. a pure exponential profile.<br>
The best-fit model in the
  r-band is fit to the other four bands; the results are stored as the
  model magnitudes. 
Details, <font color="red"> including a very important warning</a></font>, can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages.

<a name="mag_petro"></a>

<h3>magnitude, Petrosian</h3>
Stored as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroMag</b></font>. For galaxy photometry, measuring flux is more difficult than for stars, because galaxies do not all have the same radial surface
brightness profile, and have no sharp edges.  In order to avoid
biases, we wish to measure a constant fraction of the total light,
independent of the position and distance of the object. To satisfy these
requirements, the SDSS has adopted a modified form of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1976ApJ...209L...1P&db_key=AST&high=3d6550d53612836" target="new">Petrosian (1976)</a> system, measuring galaxy fluxes within a circular
aperture whose radius is defined by the shape of the azimuthally
averaged light profile.
Details can be found in the <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_petro">Photometry section</a> of the Algorithms pages and the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v124n3/202037/202037.html">Strauss et al. 2002 AJ paper</a> on galaxy target selection.

<a name="mag_pogson"></a>

<h3>magnitude, Pogson</h3> The Pogson magnitude is the standard
astronomical magnitude system, where one increment in magnitude is an
increase in brightness by the fifth root of 100.  A star of 1st
magnitude is therefore 100 times as bright as a star of 6th
magnitude. That is, for two objects <br> <code>M1 - M2 =
-2.5log(F1/F2)</code><br> where M1 and M2 are the magnitudes of two
objects, and F1 and F2 are their luminous fluxes.

<a name="mag_psf"></a>

<h3>magnitude, PSF</h3>
Stored as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">psfMag</b></font>. For isolated stars, which are well-described by the point spread function

 <a href="#frames_pipeline">Frames</a>) which analyze the raw image data, including bias
   subtraction, sky and PSF determination, flat-fielding, and finding
   and measuring the properties of objects.  The astrometric and
   photometric calibration is carried out with the <a href="#Astrom">astrometric
   pipeline</a>, and <a href="#nfcalib">nfCalib</a>. 

<a name="photo_tel"></a>

<h3>Photometric Telescope</h3> Also abbreviated PT. An 0.5-meter
telescope used for monitoring subtle changes in the atmosphere during
the course of the survey. Its principal function is to aid astronomers
in accurately calibrating an object's brightness, as measured with the
main telescope. See the <a
href="http://www.sdss.org/tour/photo_telescope.html" target="new">PT web
page</a> for more details.

<a name="plate"></a>

<h3>plate</h3>
SDSS has the largest multi-fiber spectrograph in operation in the world, observing 640 objects simultaneously. This is done by drilling holes in round aluminum plates at the positions of objects of interest, and plugging <a href="#fiber">optical fibers</a> into each hole. For a better idea, see <a href="../shared_images/plugplate.jpg">this picture</a>.

<a name="plate_map"></a>

<h3>plate mapper</h3>
An instrument that maps which plugged <a href="#fiber">fiber</a> corresponds to which target object. The 640 fibers of the <a href="#spectrograph">spectrograph</a> are placed by hand without regard as to which fiber corresponds to which position. An automated fiber mapper resolves this object-to-fiber match-up by scanning lasers across the terminal ends of the fibers and observing where they ``light up'' on the focal plane. 

<a name="psf"></a>

<h3>Point Spread Function (PSF)</h3>
The detailed shape of the response of the
telescope plus instrument to a star.  It varies with position, filter,
and time, due to changes in the atmosphere and the optics of the
telescope.  It is calculated by the <a href="#psp">PSP</a>.

<!-- <a name="poles"></a> -->

<h3>Postage Stamp pipeline (PSP)</h3>
This pipeline determines for a <a href="#run">run</a>
   the background sky, the flat-field, and the spatially varying Point
   Spread Function (PSF) in each chip, all of which will be used by
   the <a href="#frames_pipeline">Frames pipeline</a>.

<a name="primary"></a>

<h3>Primary</h3>
The ``main'' observation of an object. Because there are overlaps at many levels of the imaging (<a href="#run">runs</a>, <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>), an object may be observed two or more times. Whether or not a specific observation of an object is the primary is 
decided when <a href="#chunk">chunks</a> are <a href="#resolve">resolved</a>. Whether an object is primary or not depends on a large number of factors.

<!-- Is it in the primary area of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>, also known as a <a href="#stave">stave</a>? This implies the object has the OK_STRIPE flag set. <p> -->

<a name="primary_standard"></a>

<h3>primary standard</h3>
One of the 158 stars on the SDSS photometric
  system that is observed by the PT to measure the extinction of a
  given night, and which is used to calibrate the magnitudes of the
  secondary standards (qv).  The primary standard system is described
  in the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJ/journal/issues/v123n4/201445/201445.html"> Smith et al. 2002 AJ paper</a>.

<a name="profile"></a>

<h3>profile</h3>
An azimuthally-averaged radial
surface brightness profile. In the catalogs, it is given as the
average surface brightness in a series of annuli.  This quantity is in 
units of <a href="#maggie">maggies</a> per square arcsec. The number of annuli for which there is a
measurable signal is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> nprof</b></font>, the mean surface
brightness is listed as <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profMean</b></font>, and the error is listed as
<b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago"> profErr</b></font>.  This error includes both photon noise, and the
small-scale ``bumpiness'' in the counts as a function of azimuthal
angle.

When converting the <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">profMean</b></font> values to a local surface
brightness, it is <b>not</b> the best approach to assign the mean
surface brightness to some radius within the annulus and then linearly
interpolate between radial bins.  Do not use smoothing
splines, as they will not go through the points in the cumulative
profile and thus (obviously) will not conserve flux. What <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a>
does, e.g., in determining the <a href="#mag_petro">Petrosian ratio</a>, is to fit a taut spline to the
<em>cumulative</em> profile and then differentiate that spline fit,
after transforming both the radii and cumulative profiles with asinh
functions.  We recommend doing the same here.
<br>
The annuli used are provided in <a href="profile_table.html" target="new">this table</a>.

<h3>Quality Assurance (QA)</h3>
Generally speaking, the process by which data
are confirmed to be of survey quality.  Each pipeline carries out QA,
whose results are available for examination. After
the imaging data are calibrated, they are run through a comprehensive
set of tests (runQA) that confirm that the various photometric
measures are consistent, and that, e.g., the <a href="#zhed">Zhed point</a> is
well-behaved.  Overlap QA looks for consistency in the photometry and
astrometry of objects in overlaps between adjacent <a href="#scanline">scanlines</a> and <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>.

<a name="rerun"></a>

<h3>rerun</h3>
A reprocessing of an imaging <a href="#run">run</a>. The underlying imaging data is the same, just the software version and calibration may have changed.

<a name="resolve"></a>

<h3>resolve</h3>
A term describing the assignments of subsets of data (<a href="#field">fields</a>, <a href="#segment">segments</a>, <a href="#run">runs</a>) to fill a <a href="#chunk">chunk</a>. A chunk is "resolved" when there is sufficient data to fill a contiguous length of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. At that time, decisions are made on the best data to use (seeing, photometric conditions) to fill the desired area. A chunk can be resolved multiple times, as new data is acquired or data is reprocessed. This is why we now have multiple snapshots of the data in the database (see <a href="#target">Target</a> and <a href="#best">Best</a>)
 
<a name="run"></a>

<h3>Run</h3> A Run is just a length of a <a href="#strip">strip</a>
observed in a single contiguous observing pass scan, bounded by lines of <a href="#mu">mu</a> and <a
href="#nu">nu</a>. A strip covers a great circle region from pole to
pole; this cannot be observed in one pass. The fraction of a strip
observed at one time (limited by observing conditions) is a Run. Runs
can (and usually do) overlap at the ends. Like strips, it takes a pair
of runs to fill in a length of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>.  This
is why you may read about data taken from "Runs 752/756" or some
similar terminology. However, each individual run does contain 6 <a
href="#camcol">camcols</a> spanning the same range of nu, but not
delimited by <a href="#eta">eta</a>. These run pairs might not have
the same starting and ending <a href="#nu">nu</a> coordinates. See

<h3><u>S</u></h3>

<!-- <a name="scan"></a> -->

<!-- <h3>scan</h3> -->

<a name="scanline"></a>

<h3>scanline</h3>
A subdivision of a <a href="#strip">strip</a>. Each strip is covered by 6 "scanlines".  Scanlines are defined in
<a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle coordinates</a>. The great circle coordinate
system is different for each strip, and is defined by setting the
equator of the coordinate system to be the center line of constant eta
for the <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> to which the strip belongs.  A scanline is then bounded on the top and bottom by
lines of constant <a href="#nu">nu</a>, with no east or west boundaries. 
Scanlines touch but don't overlap, and thus are a unique mapping on the
sky for that stripe only.  Scanlines for different stripes DO overlap. This is because the scanlines come from the camera columns, or <a href="#camcol">camcols</a>, which 
have a fixed physical width, while the spherical coordinates converge at the poles. See this <a href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for details. <b>Note:</b> At times, the term scanline has been used interchangeably (and improperly) with <a href="#camcol">camcol</a>.

<h3>secondary patch</h3>
The <a href="#photo_tel">PT</a> observes a series of
  secondary patches on a given night, calibrated to the system of
  <a href="#primary_standard">primary standards</a>.  These patches overlap the 2.5m survey <a href="#stripe">stripes</a>;  with the photometry determined for these, we can set the zeropoints

<a name="segment"></a>

<h3>segment</h3>

A segment is a piece of a given <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames</a> pipeline
reduction (<a href="#run">run</a>/<a href="#run">rerun</a>/<a
href="#camcol">camcol</a>), covering a piece of a <a

<a name="spectrograph"></a>

<h3>spectrograph</h3>
The instrument used to obtain spectra of objects. SDSS actually uses two identical spectrographs, each receiving as input 320 of the <a href="#fiber">fibers</a> from a <a href="#plate">plate</a>. Details of the spectrograph can be found on the <a href="../instruments/spectrograph/index.html">spectrograph page</a>.

<a name="spectrophotometry"></a>

<h3>spectrophotometry</h3>

<a name="spPlate"></a>

<h3>spPlate file</h3>
A FITS image containing the wavelength- and flux-calibrated combined spectrum over all exposures (potentially spanning multiple nights) for a given mapped <a href="#plate">plate</a>. Output as part of <a href="#spec2d">spec2d</a>, it does <em>not</em> contain redshift information. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

<a name="spSpec"></a>

<h3>spSpec file</h3>
A FITS image containing the line measurements and redshift determinations, as well as the 1-d spectrum, for a single object, summing over all of its exposures through a given mapped <a href="#plate">plate</a>. Available in the <a href="#DAS">DAS</a>.

<a name="stave"></a>

<h3>stave</h3>
A unique region of sky, bounded by two lines of constant <a href="#eta">eta</a>. A stave is a portion of a <a href="#stripe">stripe</a> that is tapered near the poles so that it does not overlap with the neighboring stave. This term is used analogously to the meaning of stave in barrelmaking.

<a name="stokes"></a>

<h3>Stokes Parameters</h3> 
These quantities are related to object ellipticities.  Define the flux-weighted second moments of the object as:<br>
<b>M<sub>xx</sub> = &lt;x<sup></sup>/r<sup>2</sup>&gt; ,M<sub>yy</sub> = &lt;y<sup>2</sup>/r<sup>2</sup>&gt; , M<sub>xy</sub> = &lt;xy/r<sup>2</sup>&gt;</b><br>
In the case that the object's isophotes are self-similar ellipses, one can show that: <br>
<b>Q = M<sub>xx</sub>-M<sub>yy</sub> = [(a-b)/(a+b)]&times;cos2<img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"> <br> U = M<sub>xy</sub> = [(a-b)/(a+b)]&times;sin2<img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"></b><br>
where a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes and <img src="../shared_images/phis.gif"> is the position angle. Q and U are <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">Q</b></font> and <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">U</b></font> in the table
<b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">PhotoObj</b></font> and are referred to as "Stokes parameters." They can be used to reconstruct the axis ratio and position
angle, measured relative to row and column of the CCDs. This is equivalent to the normal definition of position
angle (east of north), for the scans on the equator. The performance of the Stokes parameters are not ideal at low
signal-to-noise ratio, in which case the <a href="#adaptive_moment">adaptive moments</a> will be more useful.

<a name="strip"></a>

<h3>strip</h3>

A strip is a scan along a line of constant survey latitude <a
href="#eta">eta</a>. The center of a stripe is set at a given eta;
centers of strips have a <a href="#boresight">boresight</a> offset
added. Because the columns of CCDs have gaps between them, it is
necessary to take two offset but overlapping observations to fill in a
<a href="#stripe">stripe</a>. These two scans are called strips. Note
that while strips are centered on a given eta, THEY ARE NOT BOUND BY
ETA LINES. Thus they are rectangular regions and can overlap at the
poles. See this <a href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for
details.

<a name="stripe"></a>

<h3>stripe</h3> Stripes are the sum of two strips, defined in <a
href="#survey_coords">survey coordinates</a> (<a
href="#lambda">lambda</a>, <a href="#eta">eta</a>).  A "stripe" is
defined by a line of constant eta, bounded on the north and south by
the edges of the two strips that make up the stripe, and bounded on
the east and west by lines of constant lambda. Because both strips and
stripes are defined in "observed" space, they are rectangular areas
which overlap as one approaches the poles. See this <a
href="../shared_images/sdssgeom.jpg">figure</a> for
details. <b>NOTE</b>: You may see the term stripe used to mean an area
bounded by eta lines, which would be a unique part of the sky. That is
a common use of the term, as some of the target selection
documentation uses it that way. The proper (and relatively new) term
for the unique, eta-bound portion of a stripe is a <em><a
href="#stave">stave</a></em>.

<a name="surface_brightness"></a>

<h3>surface brightness</h3>
The <a href="#frames_pipeline">frames pipeline</a> also reports the radii containing 50% and 90% of the <a href="#mag_petro">Petrosian flux</a> for each band, <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR50</b></font> and <b><font face="arial black, monaco, chicago">petroR90</b></font> respectively. The usual
characterization of surface-brightness in the target selection pipeline of the SDSS is the mean surface brightness within petroR50. 
<br>
It turns out that the ratio of petroR50 to petroR90, the so-called ``inverse concentration index'', is correlated with morphology (Shimasaku et al. 2001,
Strateva et al. 2001). Galaxies with a de Vaucouleurs profile have an inverse concentration index of around 0.3; exponential galaxies have an inverse
concentration index of around 0.43. Thus, this parameter can be used as a simple morphological classifier. 
<br>
An important caveat when using these quantities is that they are not corrected for seeing. This causes the surface brightness to be underestimated, and
the inverse concentration index to be overestimated, for objects of size comparable to the PSF. The amplitudes of these effects, however, are not yet well
characterized. 

<a name="survey_coords"></a>

<h3>survey coordinates</h3>
One of the two main coordinate systems used by the 
survey, with coordinates <a href="#eta">eta</a> and <a href="#lambda">lambda</a>. 
This is simply another spherical coordinate system, where (eta,lambda)=(0,90.) corresponds to (ra,dec)=(275.,0.) and (eta,lambda)=(57.5,0.) corresponds to 
(ra,dec)=(0.,90.). Note also that at (eta, lambda)=(0.,0.), 
(ra,dec)=(185.,32.5). So, this is a pure rotation of the usual RA/Dec system, as opposed to the <a href="#great_circle_coords">great circle system</a>, which is defined relative to each individual <a href="#stripe">stripe</a>.
For some reason, although "eta" is constant along great 
circles, it is referred to as "survey latitude," while "lambda" is referred to
 as "survey longitude." Also, "eta" runs only from -90. to 90.; the back of 
the sphere is covered by "lambda", which runs from -180. to 180. The Survey 
coordinates are defined such that the "primary" area of a <a href="#stripe">
stripe</a> (otherwise known as a <a href="#stave">stave</a>) in the north 
is defined by a rectangle in Survey coordinates which is 2.5 degrees wide in 
eta (coordinate width). <!--  You may be interested in SM routines which convert  -->
<!--  between Equatorial, Survey, and Great Circle coordinates, but we won't -->
<!--  tell you where you get them.XXX -->

<a name="survey_equator"></a>

<h3>TDI</h3>
The SDSS imaging data are taken in time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) mode at the sidereal rate almost simultaneously in five bands. The sky tracks through 5 CCD detectors in succession, each located behind a different filter. See <a href="../shared_images/camera.gif">this image</a> to get a better idea.

<a name="tilable"></a>

<h3>tilable target</h3> These are spectroscopic <a href="#target"> target</a>s which are assigned to <a href="#tile"> tile</a>s by <a href="#tiling"> tiling</a>. The significance of this is that tilable targets are supposed to have as close to uniform completeness as possible and it should be possible to define well-defined samples of such targets. The bitmasks <b>primTarget</b> and <b>secTarget</b> described in <a href="../algorithms/target.html"> the description of the target selection</a> contain the target assignments of each <a href="#object"> object</a>. Tilable targets for the survey proper are those with the <b>primTarget</b> flags QSO_HIZ, QSO_CAP, QSO_SKIRT, QSO_FIRST_CAP, QSO_FIRST_SKIRT, GALAXY_RED, GALAXY, GALAXY_BIG, GALAXY_BRIGHT_CORE, or STAR_BROWN_DWARF, and those with the <b>secTarget</b> flag HOT_STD.

<a name="tile"></a>

<h3>tile</h3>

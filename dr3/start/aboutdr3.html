<h2>What DR3 contains</h2>

<p>The DR3 imaging data cover 5282 square degrees, and include
information on roughly 141 million objects.  The DR3 spectroscopic data
include data from 826 plates of 640 spectra each, and cover 4188
square degrees.</p>

<p>The DR3 footprint is defined by all non-repeating survey-quality
imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the
Nothern Galactic Cap, and three stripes in the Southern Galactic Cap
obtained prior to 1 July 2003, and the spectroscopy associated with
that area obtained before that date.  In fact, 34 square degrees of
imaging data in the Nothern Galactic Cap lie outside this ellipse.
While the DR3 scans do not repeat a given area of sky, they do overlap
to some extent, and the data in the overlaps are included in earlier
releases as well. The sky coverage of the imaging and spectroscopic
data that make up DR3 are given on the <a
href="../coverage/index.html">coverage page</a>.  The natural unit of
imaging data is a run; the DR3 contains data from 162 runs in the best
database, and 164 runs in the target database.</p>

<p>A total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target
and best, the majority along the Equatorial Stripe in the Fall sky.</p>

<p>Except for the sky coverage, the pipelines and databases are
identical in DR3 and DR2.  Thus, DR3 is a proper superset of DR2.  The
DR2 included reprocessing of all data included in DR1, and those data
in EDR that pass our data-quality criteria for the official
survey.  For details about what changed from DR1 to DR2, please refer
to <a href="http://www.sdss.org/DR2/start/aboutdr2.html">About DR2</a>
on the DR2 web site.</p>

<h2>Imaging caveats</h2>

<h3>Red leak to the <var>u</var> filter and very red objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_redleak.html"-->

<h3>Bias in sky determination</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_sky.html"-->

<h3>Zeropoint of the photometric system</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../algorithms/sdssab.html"-->

<h3>Holes in the imaging data</h3>

<p>About 0.4% of the DR4 imaging footprint area (about 750 out of
200,000 fields, or 10/square degree) for DR3 are marked as
<em>holes</em>.  These are indicated in the CAS by setting
<code>quality=5 (HOLE)</code> in the <code>tsField</code> file and
<code>field</code> table and given in the <a
href="../coverage/holes.html">list of quality holes</a>, which
contains further details about the holes and quality flags, including
a information about a new (for DR3) table in the CAS which allows
one to query for quality information about each field of data.</p>

<h3>Problems with one <var>u</var> chip</h3>

<p>The <var>u</var> chip in the third column of the camera is read out
on two amplifiers.  On occasion, electronic problems on this chip
caused one of the two amplifiers to fail, meaning that half the chip
has no detected objects on it.  This was a problem for only two of the
105 imaging runs included in DR3: run 2190, which includes a total of
360 frames in two separate contiguous pieces on strip 12N (centered
roughly at delta = +5 degrees in the North Galactic Cap; NGC), and run
2189, which includes 76 frames on stripe 36N near the northern
boundary of the contiguous area in the NGC.  The relevant frames are
flagged as bad in the <code>quality</code> flag; in addition,
individual objects in this region have the <var>u</var> band flagged
as <code>NOTCHECKED_CENTER</code> (or, for objects which straddle the
boundary between the two amplifiers, <code>LOCAL_EDGE</code>).  <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.2945R">Richards
et al (2002)</a> describe how the quasar selection algorithm handles
such data; the net effect is that no quasars are selected by the
<var>ugri</var> branch of the algorithm for these data.</p>

<h2>Spectroscopy caveats</h2>

<h3>Note about galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/galextinction.html"-->


<h3>Problematic plates</h3>

<p>A small number of plates suffered from a variety of minor problems
affecting the quality of the spectrophotometry (but not of
redshifts). See the list under <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#badplates">Plates with
problematic spectrophotometry</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<h3>Mismatches between the spectroscopic and imaging data</h3>

<p>For various reasons, a total of 663 spectroscopic objects do not
have a counterpart in the <code>best</code> object catalogs, 0.2% of
the total. See the caveat about <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotmismatch">mismatches
between spectra and images</a> on the data products page for spectra.</p>

<!-- Waiting for PR 5904: <h2>Stetson photometry</h2> -->

<a name="dr3temp"></a>
<h2>Advanced features not yet available in DR3</h2>

<p>There are a number of advanced features or data products that are
not yet available in DR3, but will be in the near future.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Photometric redshifts for galaxies</strong> The DR1 <a
      href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> had a
  table with photometric redshifts for galaxies, including galaxies
      fainter than those in the spectroscopic survey. The redshifts
      still need to be computed and loaded into the database for DR3.</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage masks</strong> Detailed coverage masks which
      will allow large-scale structure resarchers to easily calculate
      power spectrum and related quantities are in preparation.</li>
  <li><strong>IQS/SQS</strong> The <a
      href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr3/en/tools/search/IQS.asp">Imaging
Query Server (IQS)</a> and <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr3/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro
      Query Server (SQS)</a> form interfaces have been re-enginered to
      use a faster database.  They currently do not provide a direct
      link to the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR3-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS data
      download form</a>; users need to save .csv files with the
      necessary information and upload these by hand to the DAS form.</li>

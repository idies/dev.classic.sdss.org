<ul class="pad">
  <li><b><a href="./qsocat_dr1.html">Second edition of the SDSS
      Quasar Catalog</a></b> As decribed in <a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AJ....126.2579S">Schneider
      et al. (2003, AJ 126, 2579)</a>,
      this catalog contains 16,713 quasars from DR1 that have i-band
      luminosities brighter than -22, at least one broad emission line, and
      highly reliable redshifts. The catalog is now available in ASCII and
      FITS binary table format.</li>

  <li><b>Composite red quasar spectra</b> As described in <a
      href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/astro-ph/0305305">Richards et
      al. (2003)</a>, <em>Red and Reddened Quasars in the SDSS</em>, AJ, in
      press, these spectra are composites as a function of relative
      <var>g-i</var> color, with input objects normalized such that both the
      absolute magnitude and redshift distributions are the same in like
      composites.  We provide this <a href="redqsospectra.tar.gz">tarball of
      composite red quasar spectra</a> for download.</li>

  <li><b>Composite broad-absorption line (BAL) quasar spectra</b> as a
      function of BALQSO type from Reichard et al. 2003, <em>A Catalog of
      Broad Absorption Line Quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Early
      Data Release</em>, <a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AJ....126.2594R">AJ,
      125, 1711</a> (also <a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0301019">astro-ph/0301019</a>) and
      Reichard et al. 2003, <em>Continuum and Emission-Line Properties of
      Broad Absorption Line Quasars</em>, AJ, in press (<a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0308508">astro-ph/0308508</a>).
      We provide this <a href="sdssedrqsobal.tar.gz">tarball of composite BAL quasar
      spectra from the SDSS Early Data Relase</a>; see the enclosed
      README file for more information.</li>

  <li><b>SDSS Unusual BAL Quasars</b> A sample of 23 unusual Broad
      Absorption Line Quasars has been assembled from both the SDSS EDR and
      some post-EDR data, totalling approximately 8000 quasar spectra. No
      further examples of the five categories of unusual BAL quasars
      discussed in the paper could be found among the data inspected, at
      least for spectra with SNR at least 6 per pixel in at least one of the
      g, r, or i bands (see section 4 of the paper). The paper also presents
      a revised balnicity index for deciding whether a quasar is a BAL
      quasar or not.

      <p>Calibrated SDSS and followup spectra of all 23 objects, plus
      IRAF and SM code for calculating the traditional and revised balnicity
      indices, are available in a gzipped tar file.</p>

  <li><b><a href="./wdcat/dr1/">DR1 White Dwarf catalog</a></b> as reported by
      <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2004ApJ...607..426K">Kleinman
      et al. 2004, ApJ 607, 426</a> <em>A Catalog of Spectroscopically
      Identified White Dwarf Stars in the First Data Release of the
      Sloan Digital Sky Survey</em> (also available at <a

  <li><b><a
      href="http://www.astro.princeton.edu/~ivezic/sdssmoc/sdssmoc.html">Moving
      Object Catalog (MOC)</a></b> The Sloan Digital Sky
      Survey Moving Object Catalog lists astrometric and photometric data
      for 134,335 moving objects observed prior to March 11, 2003. The
      catalog also includes orbital elements for 26,847 previously known
      objects.</li>

  <li><b><a
      href="http://acs.pha.jhu.edu/~tomo/ce/">SDSS Cut &amp; Enhance
      galaxy cluster catalog</a></b> The Sloan Digital Sky
      Survey CE galaxy cluster catalog (<a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.1807G">Goto
      et al. 2002, AJ 123, 1807)</a> uses color cuts
      combined with a density enhancement algorithm to detect clusters
      of galaxies. The SDSS CE galaxy cluster catalog contains an
      estimated redshift and richness for each cluster found in 350
      sq. deg. of SDSS commissioning data.</li>

  <li><b><a href="http://wassup.physics.nyu.edu/vagc/">NYU Value-Added
      Galaxy Catalog</a></b> The NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC)
      is a cross-matched collection of galaxy catalogs, including the
      SDSS, maintained for the study of galaxy formation and evolution. It
      includes carefully constructed large-scale structure samples useful
      for calculating power spectra, etc, and includes, e.g., the &quot;LSS
      Sample12&quot; described in various Blanton et al. and Tegmark
      et al. SDSS papers.  The SDSS data used have been reduced independently from the
      official SDSS reductions included in DR2, especially in photometric
      calibration, but the differences are minor.  There is also a
      page describing the results of <a
      href="http://cosmo.nyu.edu/blanton/lf.html">Blanton et al.'s
      determination of the SDSS galaxy luminosity function</a>.</li>

  <li><b><a
      href="http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~cwyip/eigenspec.html">Eigenspectra
      of 170,000 SDSS galaxies</a></b> As described in Yip et al.  (2004, AJ
      in press, also <a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407061">astro-ph/0407061</a>),
      this set of eigenspectra (<a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995AJ....110.1071C">Connolly
      et al. 1995 AJ, 110, 1071</a>) serves in the spectral
      classification of galaxy and in the compression of the
      massive information within the sample, among other applications. The
      rest-wavelength coverage is from 3450 to 8350 angstrom. We provide
      this <a href="./GALeSpecPUBLIC.tar.gz">tarball of eigenspectra and mean spectra</a> for
      download, containing both ASCII tables and GIF/ps plots of the spectra.</li>


  <li>The <b><a href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">Princeton spectra</a></b>
      are an alternate reduction of the DR1 spectra. The 2d reductions
      are essentially identical, but the determination of redshifts
      and classifications uses an independent code doing direct
      chi-squared fitting of templates to spectra.</li>

  <li>The <b><a href="http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/ssa">SuperCOSMOS
      Science Archive</a></b> holds the object catalog data extracted
      from scans of photographic Schmidt survey plates of the southern
      sky. The SSA catalog includes links to cross-identifications
      from the SDSS EDR and DR1, USNO-B and 2MASS final data release
      catalogs.</li>

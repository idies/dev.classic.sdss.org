<p>The EDR and DR1 data nominally corrected for galactic extinction.
The spectrophotometry in DR2 is vastly improved compared to DR1, but
the final calibrated DR2 spectra are <em>not</em> corrected for
foreground Galactic reddening (a relatively small effect; the median
<var>E(B-V)</var> over the survey is 0.034).  This may be changed in
future data releases.  Users of spectra should note, though, that the
fractional improvement in spectrophotometry is much greater than the
extinction correction itself.</p>

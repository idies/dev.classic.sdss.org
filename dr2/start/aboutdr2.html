<h2>What DR2 contains</h2>

<p>The DR2 imaging data cover 3324 square degrees, and include
information on roughly 88 million objects.  The DR2 spectroscopic data
include data from 574 plates of 640 spectra each, and cover 2627
square degrees.</p>

<p>The DR2 footprint is defined by all non-repeating survey-quality
imaging runs within the a priori defined elliptical survey area in the
Nothern Galactic Cap, and three stripes in the Southern Galactic Cap
obtained prior to 1 July 2002, and the spectroscopy associated with
that area obtained before that date.  In fact, 34 square degrees of
DR2 imaging data in the Nothern Galactic Cap lie outside this ellipse.
While the DR2 scans do not repeat a given area of sky, they do overlap
to some extent, and the data in the overlaps are included in DR1 as
well.  The DR2 includes reprocessing of all data included in DR1, and
those data in EDR that pass our data-quality criteria for the official
survey.  The sky coverage of the imaging and spectroscopic data that
make up DR2 are given on the <a href="../coverage/index.html">coverage
page</a>.  The natural unit of imaging data is a run; the DR2 contains
data from 105 runs in the best database, and 105 runs in the target
database.  The DR2 includes all data released as part of the EDR and
DR1, reprocessed as described below.</p>

<p>A total of 183 square degrees of sky are different runs between target
and best, the majority along the Equatorial Stripe in the Fall sky.</p>

<h2>Improvements to image processing</h2>

<ul>
  <li><h3>Model magnitudes</h3>
      <p>There was a serious bug in the computation of model magnitudes in
      the DR1 and EDR processing, having to do with the model of the PSF
      used.  This bug caused systematic errors in the derived scale sizes
      of galaxies, and caused model magnitudes of bright galaxies to be
      systematically incorrect.  This has now been fixed in DR2.  See the
      <a href="../algorithms/photometry.html#mag_model">description of
      model magnitudes</a> in the Photometry section of <a
      href="../algorithms/index.html">algorithms</a>
      for a detailed discussion of this problem and its fix.  <a
      href="../algorithms/photometry.html#which_mags ">Which
      magnitudes should I use</a> has further discussion of which
      magnitudes to use when.  The changes in the model magnitudes
      have also necessitated <a
      href="../algorithms/target.html#dr2LRGchanges">changes in the
      target selection for Luminous Red Galaxies</a>.</p></li>
  <li><h3>The deblender</h3>
      <p>The behavior of the deblender of overlapping images has been
      further improved since the DR1; these changes are most important for bright
      galaxies of large angular extent (&gt; 1&prime;).  In the EDR,
      and to a lesser extent in the DR1, bright galaxies were occasionally
      &quot;shredded&quot; by the deblender, i.e., interpreted as two or more
      objects and taken apart.  With improvements in the code that finds
      the center of large galaxies in the presence of superposed stars, and
      the deblending of stars superposed on galaxies, this shredding now
      rarely happens.</p></li>
  <li><h3>Improvements to PSF modelling</h3>
      <p>The PSF is measured from atlas images roughly 7&quot; across 
      for stars; any error in the sky level determined from these images
      couples to spatial variability of the PSF by the
      Karhunen-Lo&egrave;ve expansion used to model the PSF.  This manifested
      itself in systematic offsets between the PSF and model magnitudes of
      stars of several hundredths of a magnitude, even with the fixes in the
      model magnitude code described above.  This zero-point term in the PSF
      is now explicitly suppressed.</p>
      <p>The pixel size is 0.396&quot;, giving well-sampled
      images for the typical seeing of 1&quot; or more.  On rare
      occasions when the seeing became much better than
      0.9&quot; (FWHM), the undersampling causes the code that
      found stars suitable for determining the PSF to miss many
      objects, yielding an incorrect
      PSF and therefore poor stellar photometry (the seeing was never good
      enough in the runs included in DR1, so this error was not triggered).
      Changes to the thresholds for the selection of PSF stars have solved this problem.</p></li>
  <li><h3>Photometry of saturated objects</h3>
      <p>When an image is saturated in the SDSS imaging data, the wells
      overflow and a bleed trail results.  However, the total number of
      electrons associated with the object, bleed trail and all, still at
      least approximately reflects the brightness of the object.  For
      objects for which the flag <code>HAS_SATUR_DN</code> is set in a
      given band, the imaging pipeline includes the counts associated
      with the bleed trail of saturated objects in flux measurements.
      In particular, the fiber, Petrosian, PSF, and model magnitudes
      include this light, and it is added to the central value of the
      radial profile (i.e., <code>profMean[0]</code>).  As the
      pipeline works on a single frame at a time, bleed trails that
      cross frame boundaries will not be properly accounted for. In
      addition, the fluxes of close pairs of saturated stars whose
      saturated regions overlap will not be correct.</p></li>
  <li><h3>Astrometry of objects not detected in r</h3>
      <!--#include virtual="../products/catalogs/astrombug_nonrband.html"-->
  </li>
  <li><h3>Improved proper motions</h3>
      <p>The EDR and DR1 match each SDSS object to the nearest object in
      USNO-A2.0 (<a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1998yCat.1252....0M">Monet
      et al. 1998</a>), using a 30&quot; matching radius.
      USNO-A2.0 provides positions at a single epoch (no proper motions are
      provided), based on POSS-I plates.  Proper motions are then calculated based
      on the SDSS and POSS-I positions, with a typical time baseline of 50 years.
      For motions greater than &asymp;40 mas/year, corresponding to
      separations between the SDSS and USNO-A2.0 positions of greater than
      2 arcsec, contamination by false matches becomes significant and
      rises with increasing motion/separation. The DR2 reductions use
      USNO-B1.0 (<a
      href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2003AJ....125..984M">Monet
      et al. 2003</a>), which provides positions and proper motions based on various Schmidt
      photographic surveys (primarily POSS-I and POSS-II in the area of sky
      covered by SDSS).  Each SDSS object is matched to the nearest USNO-B1.0 object
      within 1&quot;, after first converting the USNO-B1.0
      positions to the epoch of the SDSS observations.  This
      eliminates nearly all of the false matches, yielding much cleaner
      samples of high proper motion stars.  The USNO-B1.0
      proper motion is then given for each matching SDSS
      object.</p></li>

<h2>Imaging caveats</h2>

<h3>Red leak to the <var>u</var> filter and very red objects</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_redleak.html"-->

<h3>Bias in sky determination</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/images/u_sky.html"-->

<h3>Zeropoint of the photometric system</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../algorithms/sdssab.html"-->

<h3>Holes in the imaging data</h3>

<p>About 0.3% of the DR2 imaging footprint area (about 300 out of
100,000 fields, or 10/square degree) for DR2 are marked as
<em>holes</em>.  These are indicated in the CAS by setting
<code>quality=5 (HOLE)</code> in the <code>tsField</code> file and
<code>field</code> table and given in the <a
href="../coverage/holes.html">list of quality holes</a>, which
contains further details about the holes and quality flags.</p>

<h3>Problems with one <var>u</var> chip</h3>

<p>The <var>u</var> chip in the third column of the camera is read out
on two amplifiers.  On occasion, electronic problems on this chip
caused one of the two amplifiers to fail, meaning that half the chip
has no detected objects on it.  This was a problem for only two of the
105 imaging runs included in DR2: run 2190, which includes a total of
360 frames in two separate contiguous pieces on strip 12N (centered
roughly at delta = +5 degrees in the North Galactic Cap; NGC), and run
2189, which includes 76 frames on stripe 36N near the northern
boundary of the contiguous area in the NGC.  The relevant frames are
flagged as bad in the <code>quality</code> flag; in addition,
individual objects in this region have the <var>u</var> band flagged
as <code>NOTCHECKED_CENTER</code> (or, for objects which straddle the
boundary between the two amplifiers, <code>LOCAL_EDGE</code>).  <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.2945R">Richards
et al (2002)</a> describe how the quasar selection algorithm handles
such data; the net effect is that no quasars are selected by the
<var>ugri</var> branch of the algorithm for these data.</p>

<h2>Improvements to spectroscopic data processing</h2>

<h3>Improvements in spectrophotometry</h3>

<p>There have been three substantial improvements to the algorithms
which photometrically calibrate the spectra: (1) improved matching of
observed standard stars to models; (2) tying the spectrophotometry
directly to the r-band fiber magnitudes measured by the most recent
version of the photometric pipeline; and (3) no longer using the
&quot;smear&quot; exposures.  These are described in detail on the <a
href="../algorithms/spectrophotometry.html">algorithms page for
spectrophotometry</a>.  These changes result in rms differences
between synthesized photometry from the spectra, and the directly
measured photometry, of 0.04 mag.  The improvements also remove a
number of unphysical wiggles which appeared in the blue end of the
spectra.

<h3>Improvements in radial velocities</h3>

<p>An error in the radial velocity templates for some types of stars
caused systematic errors of up to 40 km/s in the EDR and DR1; these
have now been fixed in DR2. The quality of radial velocities is
described in detail under <a
href="../products/spectra/radvelocity.html">quality of stellar radial
velocities</a>.</p>

<h2>Spectroscopy caveats</h2>

<h3>Note about galactic extinction correction</h3>

<!--#include virtual="../products/spectra/galextinction.html"-->


<h3>Problematic plates</h3>

<p>A small number of plates suffered from a variety of minor problems
affecting the quality of the spectrophotometry (but not of
redshifts). See the list under <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#badplates">Plates with
problematic spectrophotometry</a> on the data products page for
spectra.</p>

<h3>Mismatches between the spectroscopic and imaging data</h3>

<p>For various reasons, a total of 663 spectroscopic objects do not
have a counterpart in the <code>best</code> object catalogs, 0.2% of
the total. See the caveat about <a
href="../products/spectra/index.html#specphotmismatch">mismatches
between spectra and images</a> on the data products page for spectra.</p>

<h2>Advanced features not yet available in DR2</h2>

<p>There are a number of advanced features or data products that are
not yet available in DR2, but will be in the near future.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Photometric redshifts for galaxies</strong> The DR1 <a
      href="../access/index.html#CAS">Catalog Archive Server</a> had a
  table with photometric redshifts for galaxies, including galaxies
      fainter than those in the spectroscopic survey. The redshifts
      still need to be computed and loaded into the database for DR2.</li>
  <li><strong>Coverage masks</strong> Detailed coverage masks which
      will allow large-scale structure resarchers to easily calculate
      power spectrum and related quantities are in preparation.</li>
  <li><strong>IQS/SQS</strong> The <a
      href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr2/en/tools/search/IQS.asp">Imaging
Query Server (IQS)</a> and <a
href="http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr2/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro
      Query Server (SQS)</a> form interfaces have been re-enginered to
      use a faster database.  They currently do not provide a direct
      link to the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR2-cgi-bin/DAS">DAS data
      download form</a>; users need to save .csv files with the
      necessary information and upload these by hand to the DAS form.</li>

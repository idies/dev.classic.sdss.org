1. All pages are in the FNAL SDSS cvs repository in dr1web.
2. Make changes, add directories and files, do whatever you need to do.
3. When you are at a stable place, check in the changes, and set a tag:

cvs rtag v1_2_3 dr1web

4. Push these pages out to a web site, for example, at FNAL, do this:

cd dr1web/bin
./dr1webPublish.sh v1_2_3 /home/s1/sdssdp/WWW

5. View with astonishment what you have wrought:

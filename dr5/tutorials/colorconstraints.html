<h1>Tutorial: Obtaining Spectra based on Color Constraints</h1>

<h2>How to Find all Objects with Spectra that Satisfy a 
Given Set of Color Constraints and then Get the Spectra.</h2>

<p>This query, in particular, finds spectra for all objects at the hot
end of the WD cooling sequence. For a simple example, this list is
defined as objects with g-r &lt;-0.15 and u-g &lt;0.4.&nbsp; Normally,
when querying based on filter or color magnitudes, you should also
make sure all the appropriate <a
href="../products/catalogs/flags.html">photo QA flags</a> are set
properly (to indicate the object's photometry is trustworthy), but in
this case, since all these objects have spectra, we will assume they
were targeted and allocated a fiber based on good photometric
magnitudes, so we don't bother to check the QA flags.</p> <p><b><font
size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>

<ol class="tut">
  <li>Go to the SDSS Data Release website: <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr4">
  http://www.sdss.org/dr4</a></li>
  <li>Click on <a href="../access/index.html">Data Access</a> in the left navigation bar.</li>
  <li>Select "html" as output format if you want to look at your query
      results in your browser, or "csv" to save them in a
      &quot;comma-separated values&quot; file which you can use to
      retrieve spectra from the Data Archive Server later</li>
  <li>Click on <a href="http://cas.sdss.org/astro/en/tools/search/SQS.asp">Spectro Query Server</a>.</li>
  <li>At the first line, enter 0 to have your query return an unlimited number 
  of output rows/objects.</li>
  <li>Select &quot;minimal&quot; under &quot;Spectroscopy Parameters&quot; under &quot;Parameters to 
  Return&quot;. This will return the MJD, plate, and fiberID that you will need to 
  actually get the spectra from the DAS. (You may ALSO want to select &quot;radec&quot; if 
  you want to get the object coordinates returned as well. For now, the 
  assumption is that you only have &quot;minimal&quot; selected.)</li>
  <li>If you want to retrieve not just spectra, but also imaging data
      for the objects, select "minimal" under imaging parameters as well.</li>
  <li>Select the Best radio button between the parameter listboxes.</li>
  <li>Under Position Constraints, make sure &quot;No Position Constraint&quot; is 
  selected.</li>
  <li>Enter 0.4 in the &quot;u-g max&quot; box.</li>
  <li>Enter -0.15 in the &quot;g-r max&quot; box.</li>
  <li>Unselect &quot;Extended Sources&quot; and make sure &quot;Point Sources&quot; is selected in 
  the &quot;Object Type&quot; section of the form.</li>
  <li>Verify that nothing else is selected.</li>
  <li>Click on &quot;Submit Request&quot;. Depending on database load,
      this query takes about half a minute to run and returns 3493 objects.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>
<b>To get the actual spectra for these objects:</b></p>

<ol class="tut">
  <li>Select csv output and save the csv file to disk.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="http://das.sdss.org/DR4-cgi-bin/DAS/">DAS
      retrieval form</a></li>
  <li>Under data product, select spSpec. (You might also want spPlotGif if you 
      want to see simple GIFs of each spectrum.) The spSpec selection
      will get you the FITS file for each spectrum.</li>
  <li>If your file contains at least the "minimal" imaging parameters
      and a filter name, select fpC and bestTsObj to get the images
      and object catalogs containing your objects. (Warning: This will cause
      the query to run for a long time! You may want to retrieve the
      imaging data in a separate request.)</li>
  <li>Select the result csv file from above for upload under step 3.</li>
  <li>Since you have a lot of files here, you will get your data via
      rsync whatever option  is selected in step 4.</li>
  <li>Click on &quot;Submit Request&quot; in Step 5 of the web form.</li>
  <li>If you selected just spectra, your results should come up in
      about 15 minutes.  If the retrieval takes more than 20 minutes,
      the web server will time out the connection. You can still get
      your data by accessing the directory whose name is given on the
      results page - append that directory name to http://das.sdss.org
  and point your browser there.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the page  to transfer the
      data over to your local disk using rsync or an http client such
      as wget (the http client is recommended for large data sets; if the web server timed
      out, follow the instructions in the
      <a href="../data/rsync.html">rsync HOWTO</a>).</li>
  <li>See the tutorial on <A HREF="../products/spectra/read_spSpec.html">&quot;Displaying SDSS Spectra&quot;</A> to learn how to display your 
  new SDSS spectra.</li>
</ol>

<!-- This is the old stuff, it can replace the above once the SQS -->
<!-- provides a direct DAS link -->
<!-- <ol> -->
<!--   <li>On your return page from the above query, click on &quot;Use this result to  -->
<!--   obtain files with the DAS Web Form.&quot;&nbsp; This will take you to a WWW form  -->
<!--   from which you can download the spectra for all the objects you just found.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>Under data product, select spSpec. (You might also want spPlotGif if you  -->
<!--   want to see simple GIFs of each spectrum.) The spSpec selection will get you  -->
<!--   the FITS file for each spectrum.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>Since you have a lot of files here, you have to verify the &quot;rsync&quot; option  -->
<!--   is selected in step 4.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>Click on &quot;Submit Request&quot; in Step 5 of the web form.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>In about a minute your results should come up.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>Follow the instructions on the page (or in the <a href="../data/rsync.html">rsync HOWTO</a>) to rsync the  -->
<!--   data over to your local disk.<br> -->
<!-- &nbsp;</li> -->
<!--   <li>See the tutorial on <A HREF="../products/spectra/read_spSpec.html">&quot;Displaying SDSS Spectra&quot;</A> to learn how to display your  -->

<h2> Overview </h2>

<p>
As part of the 
<a href="http://sdssdp62.fnal.gov/sdsssn/sdsssn.html">
SDSS-II supernova survey</a>, a 2.5 degree wide region along 
the celestial equator, from roughly -50 &lt; RA &lt; 59, (SDSS Stripe 82) 
is imaged repeatedly for three 
months (September, October and November) in each of three years (2005-2007).
</p>

<p>
<b> SN scans from 2005, 2006, and 2007 Fall observing are now online! </b>

For this data release, we provide:
<ul>
  <li><b>corrected frames, fpC</b> (see the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr6/glossary/#fpC">glossary</a> and <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr6/dm/flatFiles/fpC.html">data model</a> for more information.)<br>
  </li>

  <li><b>uncalibrated object catalogs, fpObjc</b> (see the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/glossary/#fpObjc">glossary</a> and <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/dm/flatFiles/fpObjc.html">data model</a> for more infomation.)<br>
  </li>

   <li><b>Calibrated object catalogs, tsObj</b>  The non-photometric runs
are calibrated as well!</li>
</ul>

<p>
We emphasize here that this release includes data taken under
conditions below the usual SDSS survey standards. Before proceeding, 
<a href="#warning">read this note about data quality below!</a> 
Because of the variable data quality, we have chosen at this early
stage to provide uncalibrated object catalogs (i.e. instrumental fluxes in
raw data units). Once the end-user has determined that this photometry is
reasonable for their needs, absolute photometric calibration can be
attained by using photometry of stripe 82 from the most current
standard <a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/">SDSS data release (DR7)</a>.

<h2><a name="warning"> Data quality </a></h2>

<p>
In the interest of acquiring dense temporal coverage in this phase of 
the survey, imaging is done even when conditions are significantly 
poorer than the "survey standard". We provide here <i> all </i>
such data which were able to be processed through the normal SDSS pipeline. 
<i> This data set therefore includes imaging taken through clouds, 
in "grey" time (i.e. moony) and with seeing poorer than the SDSS standard 
of 1.7 arcseconds.</i>
</p>

<p>
While the data taken under survey standard conditions should be of equal
quality to that of regular SDSS data releases, we make no claims about the
quality of this data set as a whole. In particular, the performance of 
the SDSS pipeline has not been fully characterized under poor conditions, 
and the potential for systematic error exists. <i> It is left to the
end-user to assess which of these data are appropriate for their science 
requirements. </i> We provide a list of the runs included with links 
to the data on nightly transparency and seeing
<a href="http://www.sdss.org/dr7/coverage/sndr7.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b> Transparency: </b>the linked plots show the standard deviation of the pixels in 
the infrared sky map as a function of UT, and also the sky brightness.  Because
of auto-scaling in the camera, the latter is generally not meaningful.
Therefore, the top plot of the standard deviation should be used to assess
photometricity.  The line at std = 7 is a suggested threshold, but note that
this is an all-sky value.
</p>

<p>
<b> Seeing: </b> the linked plots show the median FWHM as a function of imaging
frame number.  It is computed using all objects classified as stars in each
r-band frame.  The line at 1.7 arcsec is the nominal criterion for 
"survey quality" in the SDSS.
